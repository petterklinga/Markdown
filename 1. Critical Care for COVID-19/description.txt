This course lays the foundation for providing medical attention to patients infected by COVID-19 in an ICU setting. The course structure involves several aspects of using protective personal equipment, detecting patient symptoms, collecting specimens for testing and managing sedated patients and a review of COPD, all of which will assist learners in caring for critical COVID-19 patients.

The course consists of 5 chapters, with 17 articles and 39 questions in total. Two of the chapters will also contain related videos. Before going into the theory in Chapter 1, 2, 3 and 4, we will ask an array of questions to assess your skills and identify existing knowledge gaps.
