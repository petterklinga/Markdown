# Critical Care for Non-Interventionists

This session will provide an overview of critical care for non-interventionists.

## Symptoms of COVID-19 patients

The spectrum of symptomatic COVID-19 infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe. Specifically, in a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity:

- *Mild* (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81 percent.
- *Severe* (e.g. with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14 percent.
- *Critical* (e.g. with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.

# ~Question 8
What percent of COVID-19 patients present mild symptoms?

[WRONG] Ca. 15%
[WRONG] Ca. 50%
[RIGHT] Ca. 80%
[WRONG] Ca. 70%

## Care of patients who are critically ill

The topic addressed in the sessions are:
* COVID-19 Basics
* Recognition and care of patients who are critically ill, hypotensive, in acute respiratory failure, or mechanically ventilated
* COVID-19 unit workflow
* Assessing patients' respiratory status
* Ventilator basics

# ~Question 1
What is the appropriate level of care for COVID-19 patients?

[WRONG] Higher threshold for ICU transfer as to not overcrowd it
[RIGHT] Lower threshold for ICU transfer to prevent quick patient deterioration

* Patients with confirmed COVID-19 with rapidly increasing O2 requirements, non-rebreather, or NIV should be transferred to intermediate/ICU level of care. 

# ~Question 2
In which of the following areas is it sufficient to wear a surgical mask (N95 mask not required)?
[RIGHT] In patient room
[WRONG] Areas with aerosol generating procedures
[WRONG] In room with PUI/COVID+ patients on HFNC/BIPAP
 
* In patient room: it is sufficient to wear surgical face mask, face shield, isolation gown, gloves.

# ~Question 3
Which of the following statements about intubation is NOT correct? 

[RIGHT] The threshold for patient intubation should be high
[WRONG] When performing an intubation, you need an N95 mask (instead of surgical mask), face shield, double gloves, blue plastic gown, and hat 
[WRONG] The most experienced physician should perform an intubation
[WRONG] During intubation, 2 or maximum 3 people should be in the room

* You should have a low threshold for early intubation in order to avoid emergent intubations. Covid-19 patients can deteriorate rapidly. 

# ~Question 4
Which of the following steps are part of the patient admission workflow?

[RIGHT] Use COVID-19-order set
[RIGHT] New admissions perform a medication reconciliation of home meds 
[RIGHT] Identify the head-care proxy and/or surrogates and confirm accurate phone numbers. Make sure this is documented in the advanced care planning tab and also an advanced care planning note
[RIGHT] Confirm code status with patient or with NOK/HCP/surrogate if patient is incapacitated
[RIGHT] Consult ID to discuss treatment/clinical trial options

# ~Question 5
Which of the following steps of Pre-Rounding/Rounding in the COVID-19 unit is NOT correct?

[WRONG] Get sign-out form the overnight team on new admissions and major overnight events
[WRONG] EPIC pre-rounding for vitals, labs, blood gas/lactate and vent support required, new microbiology data, ins/outs
[RIGHT] See patients or call patients as needed. Perform a physical exam if the condition of patients changes.

* The correct step is to see patients either from the door or call patients as needed. You should minimize exposure. A physical exam is NOT necessary for routine care of COVID-19 patients and is extremely discouraged.

# ~Question 6
Which of the following are the warning signs of respiratory decompensation? 

[RIGHT] Rapidly escalating O2 requirement 
[RIGHT] Inability to maintain sats in the 90s on escalated O2 therapy
[RIGHT] Respiratory distress including: tachypnea, accessory muscle use, inability to speak in full sentences
[WRONG] Severe dyspnea 

* Patients with COVID-19 often feel very little dyspnea despite being profoundly hypodermic, for unclear reasons.

# ~Question 7
Which of following is needed to assess a patient's respiratory status? 

[WRONG] Vitals : heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2 
[WRONG] Physical exam and appearance
[WRONG] ABG analysis: pH/pCO2/pO2/lactate
[RIGHT] All of the mentioned options
