# Acid Base Terminology

* Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): Used to assess acid base balance of the arterial blood
* Acid: Donates a hydrogen ion (H+)- pH 0-7
* Base: Accepts a hydrogen ion (H+)- pH 7-14
* pH: Negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration
* Mixed Venous Blood Gas: 
 * Sampled from a Pulmonary Artery Catheter
 * Used to assess tissue oxygenation

## Normal Arterial Blood Gas Values 
* pH: 7.35-7.45
* PaCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood) : 35-45 mm Hg
* HCO3- (amount of bicarbonate in the blood): 22-26 meq/l
* Base Excess (reflects the sum of all of the buffer bases in the body): -2 to +2
* PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in the blood): 80-100 mm Hg
* SaO2 (percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen): 92-99%

# Respiratory & Renal Systems

## Respiratory System
### Effects of Changes in Ventilation

* Hypoventilation leads to ineffective clearance of CO2--> ↑CO2 retention in the arterial blod -> Acidemia --> lowered pH
* Hyperventilation leads to too much clearance of CO2-> ↓CO2 in the arterial blood -> Alkalemia--> increased pH

### Influence of Non-Respiratory Acid Base Disturbances ("Metabolic Disturbances") on the Respiratory System

* Non-respiratory Acidosis [Metabolic Acidosis] -> Respiratory system attempts to compensate by "blowing off" CO2--> patient presents with increased ventilation
* Non-respiratory Alkalosis [Metabolic Alkalosis] -> Respiratory system attempts to compensate by retaining CO2--> patient presents with decreased ventilation

## Renal System
### Metabolic Causes of Acidosis

* Causes of acidosis (lowered pH) outside of the respiratory system that leads to too much retention of H+ or too much excretion of HCO3-
* Patient presents with: ↓HCO3- and ↓pH
* Kidneys may attempt to compensate by increasing excretion of H+ and retention of HCO3-

### Metabolic Causes of Alkalosis

* Causes of alkalosis (increased pH) outside of the respiratory system that leads to too much retention of HCO3- or too much excretion of H+
* Patient presents with: ↑HCO3- and ↑pH
* Kidneys may attempt to compensate by increasing excretion of HCO3- and retention of H+

# Full and Partial Compensation

### Full Compensation

* Primary disorder is being repaired by the opposing system and the pH is normal. 

### Partial Compensation

* Primary disorder continues, opposite system begins to adjust (eg. Respiratory disorder, metabolic system attempts to compensate)
* Attempts to restore ratio of 1 part acid to 20 parts base
* Can be partial or complete compensation

# ~Question 9
What is Full Compensation?

[RIGHT] Primary disorder is being repaired by the opposing system and the pH is normal. 
[WRONG] The primary disorder continues and the opposite system begins to adjust (partially or completely)

# ~Question 10

[WRONG] This patient's acid base disorder is caused by a metabolic problem
[WRONG] This patient's acid base disorder is being compensated by the respiratory system
[RIGHT] This patient'sacid base disorder is caused by a respiratory problem
[WRONG] This patient's acid base disorder is fully compensated

# ~Question 11
What is partial compensation?

[RIGHT] The primary disorder continues, the opposing system begins to adjust, and the pH is abnormal
[WRONG] The primary disorder is corrected: all acid base parameters return to normal

# Steps to Acid Base Interpretation

### Analyze each acid base parameters. 

* pH, PaCO2, HCO3-: using normal reference ranges, determine whether each value is low, normal, or high

### Match acid base disturbance with parameter causing disturbance

* pH↓ and PaCO2↑ = Respiratory Acidosis
* pH↑ and PaCO2↓ = Respiratory Alkalosis
* pH↓ and HCO3-↓ = Metabolic Acidosis
* pH↑ and HCO3-↑ = Metabolic Alkalosis

### Look for Compensation

## Partial Compensation

* All ABG values are abnormal

First: Identify the cause:
* If the cause of the ABG disturbance is respiratory: PaCO2 matches the pH (pH↓ and PaCO2↑ or pH↑ and PaCO2↓) and thus, you can determine that the cause of the ABG disturbance is a respiratory issue
* If the cause o the ABG disturbance is metabolic: The HCO3- matches the pH (pH↓ and HCO3-↓ or pH↑ and HCO3-↑) and thus, you can determine that the cause of the ABG disturbance is a metabolic issue

Next: Identify if there is partial compensation
* The opposite system (not causing the ABG disturbance) has changed in a manner that would have caused the opposite pH change. For example, in respiratory acidosis (pH↓ and PaCO2↑), the metabolic system would reflect alkalosis (HCO3-↑) in an effort to compensate. 

* Example 1: 
 * pH= 7.30 (low, acidic)
 * PaCO2= 50 (high, causing acidosis)
 * HCO3-= 20 (low, causing alkalosis)
 * CO2 and pH reflect acidosis (respiratory system is causing the disturbance)
 * HCO3 reflects alkalosis (metabolic system is compensating)
 * pH is abnormal (the primary problem is still a problem and has not been fully compensated)
 * ABG Disturbance: Partially compensated respiratory acidosis
 
* Example 2:
 * pH= 7.49 (high, alkalotic)
 * PaCO2= 30 (low, causing acidosis)
 * HCO3-= 29 (high, causing acidosis)
 * HCO3 and pH reflect alkalosis (metabolic system is causing the disturbance)
 * PaCO2 reflects acidosis (respiratory system is compensating)
 * pH is abnormal (the primary problem is still a problem and has not been fully compensated)
 * ABG Disturbance: Partially compensated metabolic alkalosis
 
 ## Full Compensation
 * pH is within normal range, but PaCO2 and HCO3 are abnormal
 * Use "7.4" as a reference point: pH= 7.35-7.4 is now labeled "acidosis", pH= 7.4-7.45 is now labeled as "alkalosis"
 First: Identify the cause:
* If the cause of the ABG disturbance is respiratory: PaCO2 matches the pH (pH= 7.35-7.4 and PaCO2↑ or pH=7.4-7.45 and PaCO2↓) and thus, you can determine that the cause of the ABG disturbance is a respiratory issue
* If the cause o the ABG disturbance is metabolic: The HCO3- matches the pH ( pH= 7.35-7.4 and HCO3-↓ or pH=7.4-7.45 and HCO3-↑) and thus, you can determine that the cause of the ABG disturbance is a metabolic issue

Next: Identify if there is full compensation
* The opposite system (not causing the ABG disturbance) has changed in a manner that would have caused the opposite pH change. For example, in respiratory acidosis (pH↓ and PaCO2↑), the metabolic system would reflect alkalosis (HCO3-↑) in an effort to compensate. 

* Example: 
 * pH= 7.36 (pH is "normal", but falls between 7.35-7.4)
 * PaCO2= 50 (high, causing acidosis)
 * HCO3-= 20 (low, causing alkalosis)
 * CO2 and pH reflect acidosis (respiratory system is causing the disturbance)
 * HCO3 reflects alkalosis (metabolic system is compensating)
 * pH is now within NORMAL range (this is the key component that moves the ABG from partially compensated to fully compensated)
 * ABG Disturbance: Fully compensated respiratory acidosis

### Look for Combined or "Mixed" Disorders

* All acid base parameters are abnormal
* Both the PaCO2 and HCO3- would have caused the pH to change in the manner that occurred (both respiratory and metabolic issues are causing the pH to be abnormal- neither system is compensating)

* Example: 
 * pH= 7.32 (pH reflects acidosis)
 * PaCO2= 50 (high, causing acidosis)
 * HCO3-= 15 (low, causing acidosis)
 * CO2, HCO3-, and pH reflect acidosis (both the respiratory and metabolic systems are causing the acidosis)
 * HCO3 reflects alkalosis (metabolic system is compensating)
 * ABG Disturbance: Mixed acidosis


# ~Question 9
What is Full Compensation?

[RIGHT] The primary disorder is repaired: all acid base parameters return to normal
[WRONG] The primary disorder continues and the opposite system begins to adjust (partially or completely)

# ~Question 10
A patient is admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. Once in the ICU, the patient was placed on the ventilator. The patient's ABG results demonstrate a PaCO2 of 50mmHg and a HCO3- of 12mEq/L. Which best describes this patient's condition?

[WRONG] This patient's acid base disorder is compensated
[WRONG] This patient's acid base disorder is corrected
[WRONG] This patient's acid base disorder is both compensated and corrected
[RIGHT] This patient'sacid base disorder is neither compensated nor corrected
[WRONG] This patient's acid base disorder is compensated but not corrected

[RIGHT] Uncompensated Respiratory Acidosis
[WRONG] Normal acid base parameters
[WRONG] Fully Compensated Respiratory Alkalosis

# ~Question 16

[RIGHT] Uncompensated Metabolic Alkalosis
[WRONG] Normal acid base values
[WRONG] Uncompensated Respiratory Acidosis
[WRONG] Partially Compensated Respiratory Aciosis
 
# ~Question 20
A 54 year old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was rushed to the emergency department with increasing shortness of breath, fever, and a productive cough with yellow-green sputum. ABG results are: pH= 7.3, PaCO2= 68 mmHg, HCO3= 28 mmol/L, and PaO2= 60 mm Hg. 

[RIGHT] Partially compensated respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia
[WRONG] Uncompensated Respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia
[WRONG] Partially compensated metabolic Acidosis
[WRONG] Uncompensated Metabolic alkalosis
 
* This patient has a low a pH so immediately think "acidosis." The PaCO2 is high which reflects acidosis-- therefore, it can be determined that the cause of the low pH is respiratory. Also based on the clinical presentation we can imagine that due to crackles and wheezes and the yellow sputum we can imagine that this patient is not ventilating efficiently and therefore building up CO2 in the blood. The HCO3- is elevated, reflecting alkalosis (the opposite direction of the problematic pH), thus this reflects partial compensation because the pH is still abnormal. The patient's low PaO2 is also cause for concern- representing hypoxemia.
 
# ~Question 21
A 10 year old male was rushed to the hospital due to vomiting and a decreased level of consciousness. The patient displays fast and deep respirations (Kussmaul breathing). The patient is lethargic and irritable in response to stimulation. He appears to be dehydrated—his eyes are sunken and mucous membranes are dry—and he has a two week history of polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss. ABG results are: pH 7.1, PaO2 90 mm Hg, PaCO2 23 mm Hg, and HCO3 12 mmol/L.
Which best reflects this patient's acid base disturbance?

[WRONG] Uncompensated respiratory acidosis
[WRONG] Fully compensated metabolic acidosis
[WRONG] Mixed acidosis
[RIGHT] Partially compensated metabolic acidosis
 
* Considering the age of this patient as well as his accompanying symptoms, the most likely cause is diabetic ketoacidosis. Kussmaul breathing demonstrates the patient's respiratory system attempting to compensate for the acidosis.
 
# ~Question 22
A 54 year old female arrived to the hospital and anxiously reports that she is having severe pain and anxiety. ABG results are: pH 7.6, PaO2 120 mm Hg, PaCO2 31 mm Hg, and HCO3 25 mmol/L. Which best reflects this patient's acid base disturbance?
 
[RIGHT] Uncompensated Respiratory Alkalosis
[WRONG] Uncompensated Respiratory Acidosis
[WRONG] Fully Compensated Metabolic Alkalosis
[WRONG] Partially Compensated Metabolic Acidosis
 
* The pH is high, reflecting alkalosis. The patient is in pain and is breathing fast, both causes of hyperventilation which lead to loss of CO2 (remember, low CO2 leads to high pH). The patient is not compensating (HCO3- is normal) and the hyperventilation has lead to hyperoxemia (PaO2>100mmHg).
 
# ~Question 23
A 80 year old female has suffered from persistent vomiting for two days. She appears to be lethargic and weak and has myalgia. She is diagnosed as having gastroenteritis and dehydration. ABG results are: pH 7.5, PaO2 85 mm Hg, PaCO2 40 mm Hg, and HCO3 34 mmol/L. Which best reflects this patient's acid base disturbance?
 
[WRONG] Fully Compensated Respiratory alkalosis
[WRONG] Mixed acidosis
[RIGHT] Uncompensated metabolic alkalosis
[WRONG] Partially compensated Metabolic alkalosis
 
* The pH indicates alkalosis. The HCO3- is high, reflecting alkalosis in the metabolic system. In this case, the cause of alkalosis is persistent loss of H+ (in stomach acid) due to vomiting. The respiratory system has started to compensate (PaCO2 is slightly elevated causing acidosis and attempting to bring the pH down into a more acidic range).
