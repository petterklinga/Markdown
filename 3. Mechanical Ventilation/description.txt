Mechanical ventilation is frequently used to provide respiratory support in times of critical illness or in patients undergoing general anaesthesia. This course provides learners with the knowledge and resources to provide essential care to critical ICU patients with coronavirus.

The course consists of 8 chapters, with 47 articles and 110 questions in total. For the chapters that have questions, we will ask an array of questions to assess your skills and identify existing knowledge gaps before going into the theory.
