I included some info on ventilator modes on the prior module-- I think that should be moved into this section- my apologies for duplicates--
Both expiratory and inspiratory pauses are not commonly used by RNs- these are procedural buttons used by RTs, I'm not sure the value of including this

I think to effectively teach mechanical ventilation, nurses should be taught this type of content in this order:

Why a patient is on the vent
What the vent can do in general
--> ventilator settings
---> ventilator modes
