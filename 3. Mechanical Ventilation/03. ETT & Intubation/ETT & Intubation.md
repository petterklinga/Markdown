# ~Question 34
What items should be retrieved before intubation?

[RIGHT] A bag valve mask
[RIGHT] A GlideScope
[RIGHT] ETT tubes

# Endotracheal Tube (ET Tube)
*  Endotracheal tubes are curved tubes used for intubation
* Tubes were previously made up of latex (indian rubber) and those are still available. Currently plastic tubes (PVC) are preferred because of the following advantages: 
 * Disposable (less chances of infection)
 * Hypoallergenic ( since latex allergy is fairly common)
 * Transparent (easy visualization of blockage ETT due to blood, pus, secretions

### Tube Components

#### Proximal End 
15 mm adapter (connector) which fits to ventilator circuit or ambu bag

#### Central Portion 
1. A vocal cord guide (black line ) which should be placed at the level of the opening of the vocal cords so that the tip of the ET tube is positioned above the bifurcation if the trachea.
2. A radio-opaque marker which is essential for accurate visualization of the position of the ET tube within the trachea by means of an X-ray
3. The distance indicator (marked in centimeters) which facilitates placement and monitoring of ET tube location.
4. A cuff to seal the airway

### Distal End 
Has Murphy’s eye (opening in the lateral wall ) which prevents complete blockage of ET tube in case the distal end is impacted with secretion, blood, etc.

### Types of Tubes
* ET tubes can be:
 * Cuffed
 * Uncuffed

* Cuffed ET tubes are used for adults and in children > 8 years
* The inflated cuff maintains the ET tube in proper position and prevents aspiration of GI tract contents into the respiratory tract.
* In children < 8 years, uncuffed ET tubes are used because the narrow subglottic area performs the function of a cuff and prevents the ET tube from slipping.

### Tube Size for Adults

 For oral intubations, a 7.0-7.5 mm ETT is generally used for an average sized woman. A 7.5-8.5mm ETT is used for for an average sized man.
 For nasal intubations, the size of the nares and nasal cavity may require using a smaller tube.


### Tube Size for Infants and Children

* The size of the ETT tube can be determined by: 

** Internal diameter of ETT (mm) = age in years + 4**

* Roughly the diameter of the child's little finger is the same as that required for the ETT

* The following table gives an idea about the size
of ETT for infants.

![](assets/ETT4.png)

The size of the ET tube increases by about 0.5 cm for every 6 months rise in age, so that at approximately 6 years of age the ET tube to be used is approximately 8 mm

### Uses of ET tube
* For Mechanical Ventilation
* For Intermittent Postive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV)
* During resuscitation
* Direct suctioning of trachea in meconium aspiration
* Provide an airway in epiglottits & life-threatening croup
* Provide an airway in tetanus, diptheria, and angioneurotic edema

### Complications
* Mechanical trauma to tongue, teeth, palate, pharynx & larynx during intubation procedure
* Stimulation of posterior of posterior pharyngeal wall leading to coughing, vomiting or vasovagal episode with resultant hypoxia, bradycardia.
* Prolonged intubation may cause pressure necrosis of laryngeal structures leading to persistant hoarseness. Tracheostomy is indicated in patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation
* Pneumothorax.

### Ambu Bag

#### Parts of the Ambu Bag
* Patient outlet (which attaches to mask or endotracehal tube)
* One-way valve unit (just proximal to patient outlet)
* Pressure releease valve
* Attachment site for manometer

![](assets/ETT5.png)

#### Size 
The size of the bag varies depending on the volume. 
Ranges from 250 ml to 750 ml for pediatric use.
Adult ambu bag volume is 1600 ml


#### Pressure release valves
Are usually set to release at pressure of 30-35cms of water

#### At the end there are two inlets
**Oxygen Inlet**
This inlet is attached to a tube carrying oxygen from the source (central oxygen line or oxygen cylinder)

**Air Inlet**
If kept open the concentration of 02 is approx 40% FiO2. for the Fi02 to be near 90 - 100%, and oxygen reservoir should be attached.

### Mechanism of Ventilation
In the resting stage the ambu bag is filled with air. On squeezing the bag to initiate ventilation the one wave valve proximal to the patient's outlet opens, resulting in release of air stored in the bag to the patient. On releasing the pressure the bag gets re-inflated with air. The patient's exhaled air cannot re-enter the bag due to the one way mechanism of the valve at the patient outlet.

#### Uses
Intermittent positive pressure ventilation
During transportation if patient is dependent on ventilatory assistance

# ~Question 1
Which method would NOT be used to confirm correct positioning of an endotracheal tube?

[WRONG] End tidal CO2 detector
[RIGHT] Asking patient to speak
[WRONG] Auscultating breath sounds
[WRONG] Chest x-ray

# ~Question 2
How often should patient with an endotracheal tube receive oral care?

[RIGHT] Every 2 hours
[WRONG] Every 4 hours
[WRONG] Every 8 hours
[WRONG] Every 12 hours

# ~Question 3
Which purpose is served by a high volume, low pressure cuff on an endotracheal tube?
[WRONG] Prevent aspiration
[WRONG] Depress cough reflex
[RIGHT] Assure ventilation volume
[WRONG] Secure the tubing

* The main reason to use high volume cuff is to obtain a good seal for better ventilation. The majority of endotracheal tubes are low-pressure high volume type. These tubes have a cuff which holds a large volume and consequently, there is a large contact area between the trachea and the tube. This type of endotracheal tube can develop folds near the contact area when inflated and consequently the risk of aspiration is high. The high-pressure low volume tubes provide better protection against aspiration but the downside is that they can induce tracheal mucosa necrosis.

# ~Question 4
Which feature of the endotracheal tube is meant to prevent distal obstruction?
[WRONG] Bevel
[RIGHT] Murphy's eye
[WRONG] Distal balloon
[WRONG] Distal airway safety mechanism

* The Murphy's eye is a safety mechanism built into the endotracheal tube. If the distal end of the endotracheal tube should become obstructed by the wall of the trachea, gas flow can still occur via Murphy's eye, positioned in the lateral wall of the tube. This prevents complete obstruction of the tube. The bevel is meant to facilitate placement into the trachea without injuring the vocal cords. A cuff is an inflatable balloon at the distal end of the endotracheal tube. The inflated cuff forms a seal against the tracheal wall. This prevents gastric contents from entering the trachea and facilitates the execution of positive pressure ventilation, however, it does not prevent distal obstruction of the tube. The “distal airway safety mechanism” is a fictional name for a portion of the tube that does not exist.

# ~Question 5
A patient's post intubation chest x-ray shows a right mainstem bronchus intubation. How many centimeters above the carina should the distal tip of the ETT terminate to avoid this event?
[WRONG] 7cm +/-2cm
[WRONG] 21 cm +/-2cm
[RIGHT] 4cm +/-2cm
[WRONG] 23cm +/-2cm

* The normal depth of the distal tip of the endotracheal tube (ETT) as seen on the chest x-ray is 4 cm above the carina (+/-2cm). A tube depth of 7 cm above the carina puts the patient at risk of placing the ETT into too shallow a position, potentially leading to the displacement of the ETT out of the trachea. The typical depth of the ETT is 23 cm for men and 21 cm for women, measured at the central incisors. Keep in mind that flexion or extension of the patient's head and neck will affect ETT depth. For instance, if you place an ETT in the sniffing position, then confirm and tape it in the same position, the ETT will be deeper when the patient's head returns to a neutral position. It is best practice to intubate in the sniffing position and then place the patient's head and neck in a neutral position to confirm the depth of ETT before taping. This can mean the difference between endotracheal intubation (correctly placed depth of ETT) and endobronchial intubation (ETT in the right mainstem bronchus), especially in infants.

# ~Question 12
A 2.5-year-old male with with status asthmaticus and a history of premature birth is about to be intubated in the emergency room. The provider finds it difficult to pass the size of ETT that is expected for the patient age and size. A 3.5 cuffed endotracheal tube is tried which does pass. Which reason best explains this problem?

[WRONG] Foreign body aspiration
[WRONG] 4.5 was too big for the patient
[RIGHT] Undiagnosed tracheal stenosis
[WRONG] Chronic lung disease

* Children born with extreme prematurity commonly require intubation and mechanical ventilation at birth or shortly after, and can remain intubated for weeks to months. Tracheal stenosis is not uncommon in these children, especially in the ones who have poorer lungs and require higher peak inspiratory pressures for adequate ventilation. 

# ~Question 13
A trauma patient who is intubated and receiving ventialtion via ambu bag is returning form a radiology procedure. He is in respiratory distress and there is an audible whoosh of air leaking when the ambu bag is used. The oxygen saturation is in the low 90's. A portion of the the pilot balloon tubing and valve has been torn form the endotrcheal tube. How can this be managed? 

[RIGHT] Use a 20 gauge peripheral IV catheter and insert the plastic cannula piece into the cut end where the pilot balloon should be. Then take a needle-free IV connector (sometimes called a clave, often blue or clear in color) and screw it onto the end of the IV cannula. This will allow you to add air to the cuff and ventilate the patient while taking time to plan for re-intubation in a non-emergency situation
[WRONG] Pull the endotracheal tube out and mask ventilate. 
[WRONG] Pull the endotracheal tube out and replace it. 

* The patient is best managed by using a 20 Gauge angiocath and a needleless IV catheter will provide a temporary solution to this problem and allow time to plan for a successful re-intubation, which may require more help or equipment being brought to the patient's room. See picture for an example of how this works. Pulling the endotracheal tube and mask ventilating, is the correct thing to do if the patient is desaturating and about to code from a bradycardic arrest, but that was not the clinical scenario given. In the question, the patient has a large leak around the endotracheal tube but is saturating consistently in the low 90s, which will not cause harm and gives one time to make a better plan. Pulling out the endotracheal tube and replacing it immediately is a cowboy move and if one misses, this could cause the patient to further desaturate and possibly cause a hypoxic or bradycardic arrest. This is a relatively stable patient with a SpO2 reading consistently in the low 90s, which is totally compatible with life. Take the time to make a plan before attempting reintubation. 

# ~Question 14
A 5-foot-2 inch tall 43-year-old woman has just been intubated in the emergency department. The respiratory therapist (RT) confirms + end-tidal CO2 and is taping the 6.0 cuffed endotracheal tube at 22 cm at the patient's teeth. On a follow up confirmatory chest x-ray, the left lung is found to be atelectatic. What explains this finding?

[WRONG] The endotracheal tube is too small
[RIGHT] The endotracheal tube is likely too deep
[WRONG] The endotracheal tube is turned the wrong way
[WRONG] The patient needs a few recruitment breaths to re-expand the left lung

* The provider placing the tube should listen for bilateral breath sounds. Had they listened, they would have noticed that 22 cm depth on a shorter adult female is way too deep and they likely taped the endotracheal tube in the right mainstem bronchus. The follow-up chest x-ray showed atelectasis because the left lung was not being ventilated. An adult female should receive adequate ventilation from either a 6.0 cuffed or 7.0 cuffed endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube diameter should not make that much of a difference, making answer number 1 incorrect. Tube size choices are often institutional, and some places may use a 6.0 cuffed in all women and others may use a 6.5 cuffed or 7.0 cuffed endotracheal tube preferentially in women, all will work. Turning an endotracheal tube 90 degrees without pulling it back will not do anything to help the atelectasis in this patient. The patient could certainly use a few recruitment breaths to re-expand the left lung, but this will only work if done AFTER the endotracheal tube has been pulled back to a proper position above the carina in the middle third of the trachea.

# ~Question 15
What is the purpose of a high volume, low pressure endotracheal tube cuff?
[WRONG] Prevent aspiration
[WRONG] Depress cough
[RIGHT] Assure ventilation
[WRONG] More secure tubing

* The main reason to use high volume cuff is to obtain a good seal for better ventilation. The majority of endotracheal tubes are low-pressure high volume type. These tubes have a cuff which holds a large volume and consequently, there is a large contact area between the trachea and the tube. This type of endotracheal tube can develop folds near the contact area when inflated and consequently the risk of aspiration is high. The high-pressure low volume tubes provide better protection against aspiration but the downside is that they can induce tracheal mucosa necrosis.

# Nasal Trumpet (Nasopharyngeal Airway)

An NPA, also known as a nasal trumpet, is an airway adjunct designed to be inserted into the nasal passageway to maintain an open airway. When a patient is unconscious, the muscles in the jaw relax, and the tongue slides back and obstructs the airway. This makes airway management necessary. The flared end is designed to prevent the device from completely entering the nose.

An NPA is used when an artificial form of airway maintenance is necessary, but tracheal intubation is impossible or inadvisable. A nasopharyngeal airway often is used in conscious patients where an oropharyngeal airway would trigger the gag reflex.

# ~Question 1
Inserting a nasopharyngeal airway is contraindicated for a patient with which condition?
[WRONG] Pneumothorax
[WRONG] Pleural effusion
[RIGHT] Severe facial injuries
[WRONG] Perforated stomach

* A nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) does not extend into the lower airway and may be used in certain situations. Insertion of an NPA is contraindicated in patients with severe head trauma or facial injuries.

# ~Question 2
Which is an indication for a nasotracheal intubation?

[WRONG] Obstructed nares
[WRONG] Basal skull fracture
[WRONG] Fractured facial sinuses
[RIGHT] Macroglossia

* Macroglossia results in obstruction of the oropharynx due to an enlarged tongue. Therefore, intubation via orotracheal route is not possible. Nasotracheal intubation via flexible bronchoscopy allows for visualization of the hypopharynx and is not blocked by the enlarged tongue. Indications for nasotracheal intubation include any form of limited mouth opening,intraoral masses, trismus, and angioedema. 

# ~Question 5
A young teenager with an asthma exacerbation requires a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). How is the correct size determined?
[WRONG] It does not matter what size you use
[WRONG] Measure from the nasal opening to the mastoid
[RIGHT] Measure from the nasal opening to the angle of the mandible
[WRONG] Measure from the nasal opening to the cricoid cartilage

* When placing an NPA, the healthcare provider should be knowledgeable regarding the sizing of the NPA. Adult sizes range from 6 mm to 9 mm. Sizes 6 to 7mm should be considered in the small adult, 7 to 8 mm in the medium size adult, and 8 to 9 mm in the large adult. If the healthcare provider is unsure of which size to use, and there is time to assess which size to use, then place the NPA at the nasal opening and orient it down toward the angle of the mandible. If the NPA goes past the mandible then it is too long and if it does not reach the mandible it is too short. Pediatric sizes should be measured via Broselow tape or should be measured from the nasal opening to the angle of the mandible. 24 french correlated with 6 mm, 28 French with 7 mm and 32 French with 8 mm. One should start with less than 5 mm in a child.

# Tracheostomy

Training is essential in all acute and community care settings to ensure that patients with tracheostomies receive appropriate care. Patients should have a bed-head sign and relevant algorithms available for use in an emergency. An emergency tracheostomy box should be available for all patients with tracheostomies on critical care units, wards or at home.

### Key points
 * A tracheostomy is a temporary or permanent artificial opening in the trachea
 * Half of tracheostomy-related deaths are due to displacement of tubes
 * All patients with a tracheostomy should have a bed-head label with information about their tube and airway management
 * An emergency tracheostomy box should accompany patients on transfer


## Permanent Tracheostomy

Discharge planning and ongoing support is essential in supporting patients who live in the community with a tracheostomy. Community practitioners, general practitioners, district nurses and paramedics need clear guidance to ensure continuity of care on discharge and to maintain patients’ safety. 

### Key points
* A permanent tracheostomy is non-weanable and cannot be removed
* Patients have to cope with an altered body image and communication difficulties
* Pre- and postoperative psychological assessment/counselling can help reduce depression and reclusive behaviour on discharge  
* Patients need support to learn new ways to communicate  
* Discharge needs to be planned carefully, as patients have complex needs

### Care of patients with permanent tracheostomy
Patients with a laryngectomy have similar problems of airway management as those with a tracheostomy. However, they also face a unique set of challenges around voice production and the effect of their surgery on their lifestyle. Patients need to be cared for by competent health professionals who also have insight into their unique problems and can offer compassionate support as they adapt to major life changes.

### Key points
* Laryngectomy is the surgical removal of the larynx
* A permanent stoma is used for breathing after a patient has had a laryngectomy  
* Laryngectomy causes a permanent loss of speech, but patients can use speaking aids
* Patients should be given information on local/regional support groups

# ~Question 2
Which artificial airway is used for long-term airway management?

[RIGHT] Tracheostomy tube
[WRONG] Nasopharyngeal airway
[WRONG] Endotracheal tube
[WRONG] Laryngeal mask airway (LMA)

# ~Question 7
Which of the following is not a goal of tracheostomy care?

[WRONG] Prevent infection
[WRONG] Maintain airway patency
[RIGHT] Ensure that the patient can swallow
[WRONG] Prevent skin breakdown

# Question 5
Identify one way to assist a patient with an artificial airway to communicate:

[WRONG] Tell family to take the patient’s glasses home
[WRONG] Encourage patient to talk
[RIGHT] Use a communication board
[WRONG] Teach the patient sign language

# Question 1
Which artificial airway intubates both the trachea and esophagus?

[WRONG] Laryngeal mask airway (LMA)
[RIGHT] Combitube
[WRONG] Oropharyngeal airway
[WRONG] Tracheostomy tube

# Question 3
Which lab value must the nurse check for a patient who may receive succinylcholine?

[WRONG] Sodium
[WRONG] PaCO2
[WRONG] Calcium
[RIGHT] Potassium
