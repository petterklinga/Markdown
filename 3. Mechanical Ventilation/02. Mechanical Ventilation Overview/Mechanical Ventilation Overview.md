# Mechanical Ventilation Overview

The following video lectures provide learners with an overview of mechanical ventilation, including ventilator modes, settings, monitoring, management and case studies.

The following links redirect to video lectures provided by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) to support you and other nurses who need to cross train to care for mechanically ventilated patients.

# Question 22
Mechanical ventilation is:

[WRONG] Chest compressions performed during cardiopulmonary arrest.
[WRONG] Use of a heart-lung machine during coronary artery bypass surgery.
[RIGHT] Use of a machine to deliver breaths to a patient who can’t breathe effectively on his or her own.
[WRONG] Use of an intra-aortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock.

# ~Question 15
Minute ventilation is equal to

[WRONG] FiO2 X PEEP
[WRONG] FiO2/PEEP
[RIGHT] Tidal Volume X Respiratory Rate
[WRONG] Tidal Volume/Respiratory Rate

# ~Question 16
What are the Ventilator Parameters adjusted to maintain the optimum Minute Ventilation?

[WRONG] FiO2 and PEEP
[RIGHT] Tidal Volume and Respiratory Rate

# ~Question 17
Which ventilator settings can be adjusted to maintain the optimum oxygenation?

[RIGHT] FiO2 and PEEP
[WRONG] Tidal Volume and Respiratory Rate

# ~Question 25
What differentiates Volume targetted and Pressure targetted modes of ventilation?

[RIGHT] Volume targetted ventilation has a predetermined tidal volume, Pressure targetted modes cease gas flow when pressure reaches the preset level
[WRONG] Pressure targetted ventilation has a predetermined tidal volume, Volume targetted modes begin gas flow when pressure reaches the preset level

# ~Question 26
A ventilator mode with a preset volume of gas that is delivered despite the amount of pressure generated is known as what?

[WRONG] Manual targetted
[WRONG] Pressure targetted
[RIGHT] Volume targetted

# ~Question 4
What are the key advantages of Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)?

[RIGHT] Patient control of inspiratory timing, mimics natural ventilation
[WRONG] Tidal volume is guaranteed

# ~Question 7
What type of mechanical ventilation augments the patient’s own spontaneous breathing efforts?

[WRONG] Control Mechanical Ventilation (CMV)
[WRONG] Assist Control (AC)
[RIGHT] Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)

# ~Question 11
Which of the following is commonly used as treatment for sleep apnea?

[WRONG] Control Mechanical Ventilation (CMV)
[WRONG] Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)
[RIGHT] Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)

# ~Question 12
One of the following modes of ventilation “locks out” the patient's efforts to breathe

[RIGHT] Controlled Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Synchronous Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Assist Control Mode
[WRONG] Pressure Control Mode

# ~Question 13
One of the following modes of ventilation places the patient at highest risk for respiratory alkalosis
[WRONG] CPAP
[WRONG] Synchronous Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation
[RIGHT] Assist Control Mode
[WRONG] Pressure Control Mode

# ~Question 14
Which mode of ventilation allows the patient to breathe spontaneously at his or her own respiratory rate and depth between the pre-set ventilator breaths?

[WRONG] Controlled Mandatory Ventilation
[RIGHT] Synchronous Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Assist Control Mode
[WRONG] Pressure Control Mode

# ~Question 18
Which of following modes of ventilation reduces the work of breathing by overcoming the resistance created by ventilator tubing but requires the patient to trigger all breaths?

[WRONG] Controlled Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Synchronous Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Assist Control Mode
[RIGHT] Pressure Support Mode

# ~Question 19
Which one of the following modes of ventilation provides a set amount of pressure for a set number of breaths per minute?

[WRONG] Controlled Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Synchronous Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Assist Control Mode
[RIGHT] Pressure Control Mode

# ~Question 20
Which mode of ventilation requires the most respiratory effort from the patient?

[WRONG] Controlled Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Synchronous Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation
[WRONG] Pressure Control Mode
[RIGHT] Pressure Support Mode

# ~Question 8
What characterizes Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)?

[RIGHT] Patient breathes independently through a ventilator circuit
[WRONG] Preset tidal volume, controlled FiO2 and gas pressure at end-exhalation
[WRONG] No preset tidal volume, no control of FiO2 and gas pressure at end-exhalation

# ~Question 10
What is a potential complication of Positive-End Expiratory Pressure?

[WRONG] Increased cardiac output
[WRONG] Decreased intracerebral pressure
[RIGHT] Increased risk for pneumothorax

# ~Question 21
