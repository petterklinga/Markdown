This course will cover the most essential elements of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), both of which can put patients at risk of serious medical complications. The course will allow the learner to gain an insight into an array of respiratory conditions as well as how they are generally diagnosed and treated in an ICU setting.

The course consists of 4 chapters, with 14 articles and 42 questions in total. For the chapters that have questions, we will ask an array of questions to assess your skills and identify existing knowledge gaps before going into the theory.
