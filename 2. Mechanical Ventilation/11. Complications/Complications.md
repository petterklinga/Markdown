# Introductory Note
Guard against incorrect ventilator settings.
Ventilator disconnection is a common problem.

## High pressure alarm
* Patient needs suctioning
* Patient is biting the tube
* Circuit tubing is compressed
* Tracheal tube has become misplaced
* Compliance is decreased
* Barotrauma -pneumothorax

## Not receiving set tidal volume
* Cuff leak/insufficient air in cuff
 * ALARM: low volume air
 * RX: Check cuff, reinflate if necessary
* Airway resistance. Decreased compliance
 * ALARM: upper airway pressure alarm**
 * RX: Check for possible obstruction

## NO tidal volume
* Patient disconnect from ventilator
* Large cuff leak
* Tube disconnect
* ALARM: low volume alarm
* RX: Reconnect tubing, verify cuff pressure, attempt to ambu until reintubation

## Increased Airway Pressure
* Secretions, mucous plug, biting on the tube
* Pneumothorax, atelectasis
* ETT slipped into RIGHT mainstem bronchus
* Increased resistance – high diaphragm with abdominal distention
* ALARM: airway pressure alarm
* RX: Suctioning, bite plate
 * Assess breath sounds for ET placement
 * Position patient
 * Sedation

## Decreased or Loss of Volume
* Leak in ventilator system
* Cuff leak
* Humidifier leak
* RX: Correct leak source

## Respiratory Alkalosis
* CO2<35 pH >7.45
* Increased respiratory rate
* Restlessness, pain, anxiety
* Rate set up too high
* Tidal volume set too high
* RX: Sedation
 * Adjust rate, tidal volume

# Complications of Mechanical Ventilation

### Infection
* Normal filtering system (nasopharynx) is bypassed by the artificial airway
* Breaks in aseptic technique may lead to nosocomial infections
* Immunocompromised, unstable, and/or critically ill patients at higher risk
* Common infection: Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) due to aspiration of gastric contents or colonized oral secretions
-->strategies to reduce VAP: Elevate HOB 30-45 degrees, hand hygiene, ensure condensation in ventilator circuit drains away from the patient's airway, suction subglottic secretions, thorough oral hygiene per facility protocol

### Airway Obstruction
* Inadequate humidification causing thickened mucus
* Increased secretions with inadequate pulmonary toiletry
* Patient biting tube

### Atelectasis
* Due to immobility/bedrest and/or inadequate tidal volume
* Monitor for low grade fever
* Frequent respiratory assessments

### Oxygen Toxicity
* Prolonged high oxygen levels – FiO2 0.7-1.0
* Excessive oxygen can impair surfactant activity, but may be needed in the short term

### Pulmonary Trauma
* Barotrauma: alveolar injury or rupture due to excess pressure (can be due to excessive PEEP, high Vt)
* Pneumothorax: Positive pressure causing a break in the integrity of the visceral pleura-- can result from severe barotrauma
* Tension Pneumothorax: watch for mediastinal shift, immediate intervention indicated- use ambu bag until physician can perform needle decompression

## Decreased cardiac output
* Positive pressure casues decreased venous return
* Inadequate fluid volume status

### Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD)
* Ventilatory muscle abnormalities induced by mechanical ventilatory strategies that suppress or eliminate spontaneous ventilatory muscle activity
* Patients perform little or no work to receive ventilatory support. Ventilatory muscles thus receive virtually no neural stimulation and have virtually no muscle loading.
* Prevent by adjusting level of unloading as fatigue recovery occurs

### Gastrointestinal & Nutrition Complications
* GI bleed --> monitor for gross and occult blood
* Stress increases gastric acid production, gastric uncelration-- PUD prophylaxis, reduce stress
* Malnutrition --> early supplemental nutrition (enteral preferred)

Malnourishment may cause:
* Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia
* Muscle atrophy
* Respiratory infection
* Decreased surfactant production
* Slowed healing of damaged tissues
* Lower serum albumin levels, edema

#### Overfeeding
* Problems with COPD and other patients unable to clear CO2
* Increased risk for aspiration
* Feeding with high carbohydrate tube feedings or parenteral nutrition increases the CO2 load
* Use of lipids to replace some of the caloric needs can reduce carbohydrate load

# ~Question 1
Which situation can cause airway obstruction with mechanical ventilation?

[WRONG] Decreased secretions
[WRONG] Excessive humidification
[RIGHT] Patient biting the tube

# ~Question 2
What mechanical ventilation complication causes a break in the integrity of the visceral pleura?

[WRONG] Pneumonia
[WRONG] Pulmonary embolism
[RIGHT] Pneumothorax

# ~Question 3
What can cause a patient to become hypotensive during mechanical ventilation?

[WRONG] Increased pulmonary blood flow
[WRONG] Normal positive pressure becomes negative pressure and increases venous return
[RIGHT] Normal negative pressure becomes positive pressure and decreases venous return

# ~Question 4
How can you help prevent ventilator-associated (VAP) pneumonia in mechanical ventilated patients?

[WRONG] Decreasing PEEP and increasing FiO2 settings
[WRONG] Placing the head of bed flat
[RIGHT] Providing regular oral care

# ~Question 7
Patients with Ventilator-Induced Diaphragmatic Dysfunction (VIDD) will:

[RIGHT] Be difficult to wean from the ventilator
[WRONG] Be difficult to ventilate with low tidal volumes
[WRONG] Encounter higher risk of infection
[WRONG] Have a low cardiac output

# ~Question 8
How can you prevent Ventilator-Induced Diaphragmatic Dysfunction (VIDD):

[WRONG] Sedating the patient to make the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles rest until the infection is fully treated.
[RIGHT] Limiting controlled ventilation to the minimum necessary. As soon as the patient's respiratory drive recovers, the patient should trigger the ventilator and participate in the breathing effort.
[WRONG] Giving high level of ventilator support to the patient until the disease is completely treated, then training the patient with very little assist for long periods.
[WRONG] Allowing spontaneous breathing during the entire period on mechanical ventilation, despite other indications.

# ~Question 1
Malnourishment may cause:
