# Introduction to Alarms
Alarm systems are used to alert the healthcare team to potential problems with the ventilator and/or patient. Never turn off alarms for a ventilator. Alarms can be silenced temoprarily, but immmediate assessment and action is indicated. The most common alarms that nurses will encounter are "high pressure," "low pressure," and "low volume" alarms, but during the ventilator weaning process, a patient may also trigger an "apnea" alarm. Upon hearing any alarm, an efficient focused assessment should be conducted followed by an action to address the issue causing the alarm.

In an emergency, or when the ventilator has failed/malfunctioned, manual ventilation with the bag valve mask (BVM) hooked up to oxygen may be necessary- this is why it is critical that all patients receiving mechanical ventilation have a BVM readily available at the bedside.

# High Pressure Alarm
Triggered when pressure increases anywhere in circuit. Typically occurs when the ventilator encounters 10cmH2O above average PIP.
Potential causes:
* Secretions (Patient needs suctioning, thickened secretions can benefit from humidification)
* Patient agitation/noncompliance with the ventilator (sedation may need to be increased, pain/anxiety may need to be addressed)
* Patient is biting the ETT (Patient may need more sedation and/or a bite block)
* Tracheal tube has migrated down into a main bronchus (Chest X-Ray to confirm placement, consultation with physician, tube likely needs to be pulled back a specified number of centimeters according to physician recommendations)
* Lung compliance is decreased (Consider patient's condition could be declining, is also a sign of ARDS, consultation with physician)
* Barotrauma (Chest X-ray, consultation with physician)

# Low Pressure Alarm
Triggered when pressure is decreased anywhere in the circuit.
Potential causes:
* Patient has disconnected themselves from the ventilator/extubated themselves (Provide supplemental oxygen and bag valve mask (BVM) if necessary, call the physician, patient often needs to be reintubated)
* A part of the ventilator circuitry has been disconnected (assess all ventilator circuitry and reconnect, consult with RT)

# Low Volume Alarm
Triggered with the patient's minute volume or tidal volume is low. This can be very similar to low pressure alarms, but not always.
Potential causes:
* Cuff leak/insufficient air in cuff- presents as gurgling or bubbling around the airway (Consult with RT to reinflate the cuff at appropriate pressure)
* A part of the ventilator circuitry has been disconnected (assess all ventilator circuitry and reconnect, consult with RT)
* If patient has a chest tube, air leak in chest tube system (assess severity, consult withe the physician)
* Decreased lung compliance in a patient in a pressure-targetted mode (patient resistance to the ventilator is reducing the amount of volume delivered- could be due to fatigue or worsening condition- consult with the physician and RT)

# Apnea Alarm
This most commonly occurs for patients who are being "weaned" from the ventilator and are in a less supportive mode (eg. CPAP, PS). Commonly triggers when the patient does not initiate a breath for > 20 seconds. Ventilator will default to a back up mode pre-set by the RT.
Potential causes:
* Poor respiratory drive (assess level of sedation or underlying pathology, consult with physician and RT)
* Oversedation (assess level of sedation- often sedation needs to be stopped during CPAP and PS to ensure adequate respiratory drive)
* Patient's general condition is worsening (consult with the physician, CPAP or PS trial needs to be stopped and patient needs to be placed on a more supportive mode)

# Summary: Alarms

### High-Priority Alarms

These alarms must not be ignored, patient safety is at risk! These alarms cannot be reset until rectified.
If any of these alarms occur, assess your
patient: If VS are stable, then attempt to correct the issue, if VS are not stable (especially SpO2), manually ventilate the patient with BVM and call the RT.
* Persistent high pressure alarms due to severe occlusion
* Low pressure alarms (often can signify the patient has extubated themselves)

### Low and Medium Priority (! And !!)

* These alarms are indicators of a change in a patients ventilation status and should be addressed.
  * Temporary high pressure alarms: Coughing, Secretions, Water/condensation in the ventilator circuitry

# Potential Mechanical Ventilator Complications

We will be covering the following complications:
* Laryngeal or tracheal injury
* Skin integrity
* Oxygen toxicity
* Hypoxemia
* Respiratory Acidosis or Alkalosis
* Decreased cardiac output

# Laryngeal or tracheal injury
* The ETT cuff can place excessive pressure on the trachea and cause tracheal ischemia or even necrosis
* As the patient moves, the ETT may also irritate the trachea and larynx causing abraisive injury
* Prevention is key: RTs are often responsible for regularly monitoring cuff pressures with a monometer. Target cuff pressure should be 25-30mmHg

# Skin integrity
* ETT securement devices can cause skin breakdown and also damage mucosa
* Securement devices and/or tape should be changed per facility protocol and patient's skin should  be assessed and protected regularly.

# Oxygen toxicity
* Delivering too high FiO2 ("hyperoxia")- irritant effects of oxygen can cause lung damage
* --> Avoid long term delivery of high FiO2 (eg. avoid 100% FiO2 longer than 24h), consider other strategies to enhance oxygenation outside of increasing FiO2 (eg. increase PEEP)

# Hypoxemia
* VQ mismatch
* Underlying pulmonary conditions and complications, or iatrogenic complications: pulmonary embolus, pulmonary edema
* --> Monitor ABG, adjust FiO2 accordingly, Adjust ventilator settings (eg. PEEP) to enhance ventilation and oxygenation

# Respiratory Acidosis or Alkalosis
* Ventilator mode is not providing enough ventilator support and/or the patient does not have enough respiratory effort--> hypoventilation--> respiratory acidosis
* Ventilator mode is providing too much ventilation and/or the patient is hyperventilating --> hyperventilation --> respiratory alkalosis
* --> Changes to ventilator modes and settings as well as sedation or even neuromuscular blockade are considerations to correct acid base disturbances.

# ~Question 10
A patient presents with respiratory alkalosis, which action is appropriate?

[WRONG] Reduce sedation drip rate
[WRONG] Increase the respiratory rate alarm parameters
[WRONG] Increase the PEEP setting
[RIGHT] Assess the patient for pain and/or anxiety

# Decreased cardiac output
* Decreased venous return (preload) due to positive pressure from the ventilator (especially with high PEEP settings)
* Decreased preload leads to decreased cardiac output
