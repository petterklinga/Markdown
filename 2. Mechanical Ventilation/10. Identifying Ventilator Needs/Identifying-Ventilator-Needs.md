# Indications for Mechanical Ventilation

### Inability to maintain adequate ventilation

* Ventilation – ability to remove CO2 from lungs
* High PaCO2 – hypoventilation
* Low PaCO2 - hyperventilation

### Inability to maintain adequate oxygenation

* Hypercarbia and hypoxemia frequently occur together
* Hypoxemia with low to normal CO2
* PaO2 cannot be maintained >50 mmHg by increasing FiO2 through other means

### Work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain

* Ventilation is inefficient and exhausting
* Increased RR due to stiff compliance
* Decreased vital capacity

### Related reasons for endotracheal intubation

* Isolate and protect the airway.
* Relieve airway obstruction.
* Facilitate suctioning of the tracheobronchial tree.

# ~Question 1
What is hypoventilation? 

[RIGHT] High PaCO2 
[WRONG] Low PaCO2 

# ~Question 2
What is hyperventilation? 

[RIGHT] Low PaCO2
[WRONG] High PaCO2

# ~Question 3
What findings indicate that the work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain?

[RIGHT] Increased respiration rate due to stiff compliance, decreased vital capacity
[WRONG] Decreased respiration rate, increased vital capacity

# ~Question 4
Which of the following is an indication for endotracheal intubation?

[WRONG] Provide fluids to the lungs
[WRONG] Remove pericardial fluid
[RIGHT] Isolate and protect the airway

# ~Question 5
What does decreased vital capacity indicate?

[WRONG] The patient has limited cardiac output
[WRONG] The patient has adequate breathing ability
[RIGHT] The work of breathing is excessive for the patient

# ~Question 6
Which of the following is NOT likely to be an indication for mechanical ventilation?

[RIGHT] Myocardial infarction (MI)
[WRONG] Respiratory failure
[WRONG] Provide stability of the chest wall after trauma or surgery
[WRONG] Brain injury requiring a barbiturate-induced coma
