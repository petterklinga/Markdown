# Mechanical Ventilators 

Mechanical ventilation is indicated for patients with respiratory failure who are unable to maintain adequate gas exchange.
Mechanical ventilators deliver positive pressure using a number of settings within a specified overall mode.

# ~Question 22
Mechanical ventilation is:

[WRONG] Chest compressions performed during cardiopulmonary arrest.
[WRONG] Use of a heart-lung machine during coronary artery bypass surgery.
[RIGHT] Use of a machine to breathe for a patient who can’t breathe effectively on his or her own.
[WRONG] Use of an intra-aortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock.

# Mechanical Ventilator Settings 
Mechanical ventilators can be programed to deliver a number of specific settings. Keep in mind that not all modes use all of the following settings.
* FiO2: fraction of inspired oxygen (percentage of oxygen delivered)
* RR/f: respiratory rate or frequency (number of breaths delivered per minute by the ventilator)
* Vt: tidal volume (size of each breath)
* PS: pressure support (amount of pressure delivered with each breath)
* PEEP: Positive End Expiratory Pressure (additional positive pressure provided at the end of expiratio to keep alveoli open)
* I:E ratio: Inspiratory/Expiratory ratio, or the duration of inhalation compared to exhalation

## Measured Values
* PIP – Peak Inspiratory Pressure
* PEEP – Positive End Expiratory Pressure (Measured)
* I:E – Inspiratory to Expiratory Ratio 
* F(tot) – Total respiratory rate, mechanical and spontaneous
* Vt(e) – Measurement of Exhaled tidal volume
* Ve(tot) – Total Minute Volume (Ftot X Vte)

# Modes of Mechanical Ventilators

The "mode" describes the ventilator's general relationship with the patient. Settings can vary within a mode. Modes can be pressure targetted or volume targetted and the level of support can vary from mode to mode. In some modes, the ventilator does all of the work of breathing, while other modes can require the patient to do more work of breathing.

### Volume Targetted
* Preset volume of gas (tidal volume or "Vt") is predetermined and delivered despite the amount of pressure generated

### Pressure Targetted
* Preset pressure of gas delivery is predetermined
* Gas flow to patient ceases when pressure reaches preset level
* May mean that patient does not receive targeted
tidal volume

# ~Question 25
What differentiates Volume targetted and Pressure targetted modes of ventilation?

[RIGHT] Volume targetted ventilation has a predetermined tidal volume, Pressure targetted modes cease gas flow when pressure reaches the preset level
[WRONG] Pressure targetted ventilation has a predetermined tidal volume, Volume targetted modes begin gas flow when pressure reaches the preset level

# ~Question 26
A ventilator mode with a preset volume of gas that is delivered despite the amount of pressure generated is known as what?

[WRONG] Manual targetted
[WRONG] Pressure targetted
[RIGHT] Volume targetted

# Select modes 
All of these modes will include a pre-set PEEP and FiO2, from there, the additional support may be provided depending on the mode

## Control Mandatory Ventilation (CMV)
* Preset tidal volume and respiratory rate
* Patient cannot take any spontaneous breaths

#### Disadvantages
* No spontaneous breathing
* Patient cannot adjust to changes in demands
* Lack of control – can cause discomfort/anxiety
* May lead to hyperventilation
* Requires sedation/paralysis

## A/C – Assist Control
* Volume targetted mode
* Each breath is either “Assisted” or “Controlled”
* Provides a predetermined set number of breaths (RR), each with a pre-set tidal volume (Vt). 
* Controlled breaths are determined by the rate or frequency (“f”) that is set.
* The patient may take additional breaths above the pre-set number (RR setting), and those additional breaths will be supported by the preset tidal volume as well.

#### Advantages
* Patient is guaranteed a set number of breaths
* Patient sets own breath interval and can take spontaneous breaths
* Resting of respiratory muscles

#### Disadvantages
* May decrease cardiac output
* Respiratory alkalosis (if patient takes too many spontaneous breaths, all of those are supported with the pre-set tidal volume)

## Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)
* Volume targetted mode
* Combines spontaneous breathing with mechanical ventilatory support
* Provides a predetermined set number of breaths (RR), each with a preset tidal volume (Vt).
* The patient may take additional breaths above the pre-set number (RR setting), however, those additional breaths will NOT be supported by the preset tidal volume- the volume of these breaths will be determined by patient effort

#### Advantages
* Synchronized respirations – less stacking and air trapping
* Allows exercise of respiratory muscles
* Possible less respiratory alkalosis in anxious patient (spontaneous breaths are not supported by pre-set tidal volume)

### Disadvantages
* Limited capacity to meet increasing ventilatory demands (depending on set respiratory rate)
* Resp acidosis may occur if insufficient ventilation
* Fatigue of respiratory muscles can occur due to increased work of breathing placed on the patient

## Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)
* Pressure targetted mode
* Provides a preset pressure when a patient "triggers" the ventilator (demonstrates inspiratory effort). 
* There is NO pre-set respiratory rate or tidal volume. 
* The patient will determine their own respiratory rate, but each effort to take a breath will be supported by a set pressure amount.

#### Advantages
* Patient controls inspiratory timing
* Gas flow can be changed to increase comfort
* Work of breathing can be relieved or progressively allowed
* Used in weaning
* Support ventilation along with SIMV (a set PS can be added on to spontaneous breaths to provide support)

#### Disadvantages
* Tidal volumes can decrease – in the case of decreased lung compliance
* Patient must have respiratory drive- no breaths will be delivered unless the patient triggers them
* Not for full support of unstable patients
* Back-up rate is not guaranteed if used alone

## Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV)
* Pre-set amount of pressure (PS) delivere with a set number of breaths (RR)
* If patient takes spontaneous breaths above the pre-set RR, these breaths are also supported by the present PS
* Mechanical inspiratory phase limited to prevent lung trauma

#### Advantage
* More natural feeling/comfortable for the patient

#### Disadvantages
* Tidal volume is not guaranteed
* Hypoventilation risk in patients with low lung compliance

## Pressure Controlled Inverse-Ratio Ventilation (PC-IRV)
* Same as PCV, except in addition, the inspiratory phase is longer than expiratory phase providing an I:E ratio from 2:1 to 4:1 (instead of normal I:E ratio of 1:2)

#### Advantage
* Improved arterial oxygenation and ventilation with lower peak pressure

#### Disadvantages
* Limited use – requires technical support and experience
* Can require more sedation and patient may need neuromuscular paralysis

# Adjuncts to Mechanical Ventilation

#### Complications of Positive Pressure Ventilation
* Reduced cardiac output due to increased intrathoracic pressure
* May increase intracerebral pressure
* Increase risk for barotrauma
* Increase risk for pneumothorax

### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
* Provides continuous positive pressure either invasively (eg. through the endotracheal tube) or noninvasively (eg. through tightly-fitting mask)
* Settings: PEEP and FiO2
* Patient must trigger all breaths- no pre-set respiratory rate
* No preset tidal volume
* Noninvasive CPAP used most often with patients as a last effort before intubation
