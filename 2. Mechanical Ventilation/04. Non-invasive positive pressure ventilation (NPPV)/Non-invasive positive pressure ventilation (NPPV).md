# Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation

For air to enter the lungs, a pressure gradient must exist between the airway and the alveoli. This can be accomplished either by raising pressure at the airway (positive-pressure ventilation) or by lowering pressure at the level of the alveolus (negative-pressure ventilation).

The iron lung or tank ventilator is the most common type of negative-pressure ventilator used in the past. These ventilators work by creating subatmospheric pressure around the chest, thereby lowering pleural and alveolar pressure and facilitating flow of air into the patientâ€™s lungs.

Method of ventilation without an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy: tight-fitting nasal, oro-nasal or face mask attached to a non-invasive positive pressure ventilator (NPPV or CPAP/BIPAP) unit.

The NPPV unit can be programmed to deliver:

* Respiratory rate
* Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP)
* Expiratory pressure (EPAP)
* Supplemental FiO2

## Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
Provides continuous positive pressure to keep alveoli open and enhance ventilation and oxygenation
* Decreases work of breathing (WOB)
* Increases Oxygenation by enhancing ventilation and facilitating oxygen delivery
* Potential complication: Positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure which can decrease cardiac preload (blood return to the heart) and thus cardiac output (blood pumped out of the heart)

## Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP)
Provides two levels of continuous positive pressure: one amount of pressure during exhalation (to keep alveoli open) and one (higher) amount of pressure during inhalation (to keep alveoli open and to further decrease WOB)
* Decreases work of breathing (WOB)- can provide more support than CPAP
* Increases Oxygenation by enhancing ventilation and facilitating oxygen delivery
* Potential complication: Positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure which can decrease cardiac preload (blood return to the heart) and thus cardiac output (blood pumped out of the heart)

# ~Question 2
An artificial airway, like an endotracheal tube, is used in the following type of ventilation

[RIGHT] Positive Pressure
[WRONG] Negative pressure

# ~Question 3
Pressure is applied to the abdomen and thorax to draw air into the lungs through the upper airway in the following type of ventilation

[WRONG] Positive Pressure
[RIGHT] Negative pressure

# ~Question 4
Iron lung ventilators used after the polio epidemics in the first half of the 20th century belong to

[WRONG] Positive Pressure Ventilation
[RIGHT] Negative pressure Ventilation

# Nursing Considerations

### Indications:
* To avoid intubation in a patient with respiratory distress
* To avoid reintubation in a patient who has been extubated
* To provide ventilatory support in a patient who is "DNI" (do not intubate)

### Contraindications:
* Somnolence
* Claustrophobia
* High aspiration risk
* Inability to clear secretions
* Recent facial or gastroesophageal surgery
* Craniofacial trauma
* Burns

### Nursing Care
* Aerosolized Intervention: Use N95 mask when caring for patients using either BiPAP or CPAP.
* Collaborate with respiratory therapy to ensure mask fits appropriately and there are no air leaks
* Monitor patient's tidal volume, ABG, RR
* Monitor for signs of respiratory decompensation

### Monitor for potential complications:
* Signs of low preload and low cardiac output
* Skin integrity issues around face and drying of mucous membranes
* Patient comfort due to nature of mask
* Aspiration
* Respiratory drive
* Malnutrition or dehydration (due to possible reduced oral intake)

# ~Question 2
What is the difference between invasive and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation?

[RIGHT] Invasive positive pressure ventilation is delivered via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy

[WRONG] Somnolence
[RIGHT] Sleep apnea
[WRONG] Upper airway tumor
[WRONG] Copious thick secretions

# ~Question 5

[WRONG] in conjunction with bronchodilators and steroids
[WRONG] to delay intubation
[WRONG] as a weaning protocol
[RIGHT] All of the options
