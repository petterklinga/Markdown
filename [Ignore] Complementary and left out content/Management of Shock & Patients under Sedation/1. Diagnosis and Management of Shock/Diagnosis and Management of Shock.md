# Diagnosis and Management of Shock

Septic shock and specific organ dysfunction such as acute kidney injury appear to occur in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19â€“related critical illness and are associated with increasing mortality. Recommendations for managing shock follow the available evidence-based guidelines.

In the care of COVID-19 patients, it is important to be able to **respond promptly to a patient in shock**.

The goals of this session are:
* Review the primary categories of shock
* Discuss goals of resuscitation in shock
* Summarize principles of shock management
* Describe effects of vasopressor and inotropic agents
* Discuss the different causes and management strategies for oliguria
