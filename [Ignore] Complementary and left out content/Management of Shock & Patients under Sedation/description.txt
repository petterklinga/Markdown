Critical COVID-19 patients are often sedated to facilitate mechanical ventilation while they recover from the illness. A significant proportion of them often develop septic shock and specific organ dysfunction such as acute kidney injury. This course provides guidelines on how to respond promptly to a patient in shock and on how to manage a patient receiving sedation.
 
The course consists of 2 chapters, with 12 articles and 19 questions in total. The first chapter consists of a video lecture, and for the second chapter we will ask an array of questions to assess your skills and identify existing knowledge gaps before going into the theory.
