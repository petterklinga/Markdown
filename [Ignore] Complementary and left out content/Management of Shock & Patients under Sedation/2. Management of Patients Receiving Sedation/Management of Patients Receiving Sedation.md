# Introduction to Sedation Monitoring

## After successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
1. Differentiate minimal, moderate or procedural sedation/analgesia, deep sedation, and anesthesia.
2. State recommended dosage, rate of administration, onset and duration of action, and adverse effects of sedation agents.
3. Describe the recommended dosage, rate of administration, onset, and duration of action of reversal agents for opiates and benzodiazepines.
4. Demonstrate techniques to maintain a patent airway and adequate oxygenation.
5. Identify potential complications related to sedation.

## The modules will also cover the following medications generally associated with sedation:
1. Propofol
2. Fentanyl
3. Versed
4. Dilaudid
5. Dexmedetomidine

## Brief Introduction
Sedation can decrease anxiety, pain, and discomfort. Some sedatives can induce amnesia, so that the patient does not remember an unpleasant procedure. Sedation is often used in critical care settings to facilitate mechanical ventilation while the patient receives treatment and recovers from an illness or injury.  Sedation is a high risk activity, requiring careful patient assessment. Protocols for medication usage, monitoring, and documentation standards will be discussed in this course.

### Note!
Keep in mind that your facility will also have very specific policies and procedures that indicate where and who can perform or assist with sedation. Do not assist with procedural sedation unless you have received appropriate training. Critical care nurses routinely administer sedation to mechanically ventilated patients. Only anesthesia providers administer procedural sedation to patients who are not already on mechanical ventilation. The Joint Commission and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommend that persons administering or monitoring procedural sedation be trained to administer any advance lifesaving measures if the patient changes from moderate sedation to deep sedation.

# ~Question 1
Rescuers should be prepared to recognize and support a sedated patient who is not able to maintain an open airway.

[RIGHT] True
[WRONG] False

# ~Question 2
Sedation is often used in critical care settings.

[RIGHT] True
[WRONG] False

# Levels of Anesthesia
**There are four levels of anesthesia:**
1. Minimal or light sedation (anxiolytics)
2. Moderate sedation/analgesia or procedural sedation and analgesia
3. Deep sedation/analgesia
4. General anesthesia

## Minimal or Light Sedation (Anxiolytics)
This is defined as a “trancelike” state. Patients respond normally to verbal commands, although there may be impaired cognitive function and physical coordination. The patient experiences pain relief and may be amnesic. The patient retains protective airway reflexes, spontaneous respirations, and cardiopulmonary stability.

## Moderate Sedation
Moderate sedation is often used with procedures in the gastrointestinal or endoscopy suite, pulmonary lab, intensive care units (ICUs), emergency departments (EDs), and other clinical locations. According to The Joint Commission, patients covered by sedation policies include:
* Situations that do not require the services of a qualified anesthesia provider (generally relatively non-invasive procedures on healthy patients).
* All non-intubated patients receiving moderate sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

## Definition of Moderate Sedation
A minimally depressed level of consciousness in which a patient retains the ability to independently and continuously maintain an open airway and a regular breathing pattern. The patient can respond appropriately and rationally to physical stimulation and verbal commands. Moderate sedation may be induced by parenteral or oral medications. Drugs, dosages, and techniques utilized are not intended to produce loss of consciousness.

## Clinical Characteristics of Moderate Sedation
* Maintenance of protective reflexes (e.g., ability to control secretions, avoid aspiration, and breathe without assistance)
* Independent and continuous maintenance of a patent airway
* Appropriate response to physical stimulation and/or verbal command
* Easy arousal and responds to verbal or light tactile stimulation
* Cardiovascular status is usually maintained

## Deep Sedation/Analgesia
Deep sedation/analgesia is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which the patient cannot be easily aroused, but responds purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation.

Independent ventilatory function may be impaired. The patient may require assistance to maintain a patent airway. Spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained

## Clinical Characteristics of Deep Sedation
* Not easily aroused
* May require repeated or painful stimulation to elicit a response
* Partial or complete loss of protective reflexes
* Loss of ability to maintain a patent airway
* Cardiovascular function usually maintained

## General Anesthesia
A drug-induced loss of consciousness during which the patient is not arousable, even to painful stimuli. The ability to maintain independent ventilatory function is often impaired. Assistance is often required in maintaining a patent airway. Positive pressure ventilation may be required due to depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired.

# ~Question 3
Which level of sedation signifies a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands and/or light tactile stimulation, no interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, spontaneous ventilation is adequate, and cardiovascular function is usually maintained?

[WRONG] Minimal sedation
[RIGHT] Moderate sedation
[WRONG] Deep sedation
[WRONG] General anesthesia

# ~Question 4
Which finding is NOT expected for a patient receiving Minimal Sedation?

[WRONG] Normal response to verbal commands
[WRONG] Retains protective airway reflexes
[WRONG] Cardiopulmonary stability
[RIGHT] Cardiovascular function may be impaired

# ~Question 5
During which level of sedation is a patient unarousable?

[WRONG] Deep Sedation
[RIGHT] General Anesthesia
[WRONG] Minimal Sedation
[WRONG] Moderate Sedation

# Levels of Sedation: Modified Ramsay Scale

It is important to determine the health team's goal for the level of sedation. Light, moderate, or deep sedation may be used in the critical care unit, based on the specific patient needs. The Modified Ramsay Scale is often used to assess the patient's ongoing level of sedation and adjust the dosage and timing of sedatives.

![](assets/ramsay.jpg)

## Review of the Levels of Sedation
1. No sedation
2. Light sedation
3. Moderate sedation
4. Deep sedation
5. General anesthesia

## Clinical Characteristics of Different Levels of Sedation

![](assets/sedation2.png)

## Levels of Sedation
The non-anesthesia provider should be knowledgeable about the differences in the sedation levels and be able to determine when the patient is approaching deep sedation or general sedation. It is not always possible to predict a patient’s response to sedation.

Be prepared to rescue a patient who moves to an unintended level of sedation.

### The Sedation Continuum

# ~Question 6
The modified Ramsay Scale is often used to assess the patient's ongoing level of sedation and adjust the dosage and timing of sedatives.

[RIGHT] True
[WRONG] False

# ~Question 7

[WRONG] Moderate sedation
[RIGHT] Deep sedation
[WRONG] General anesthesia

# Regulation and Oversight of Sedation
The requirements for safe administration of medications and safe practice of procedural sedation are defined by The Joint Commission and other accreditation agencies, professional regulatory boards, and individual hospital policies. Practitioners should review and understand their scope of practice with procedural sedation as they will need to follow the policies for patient safety and to ensure regulatory compliance.

# ~Question 8
When regulating and overseeing sedation, who is generally the operator?

[WRONG] The RN
[RIGHT] The MD

# Propofol
Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic used for procedural sedation, during monitored anesthesia care, or as an induction agent for general anesthesia. It may be administered as a bolus, an infusion, or a combination. Propofol is prepared in a lipid emulsion which gives it the characteristic milky white appearance.

### Clinical Uses of Propofol:
* Sedation in intubated, mechanically-ventilated ICU patients
* Sedation during monitored anesthesia care for patients undergoing procedures
* Maintenance of anesthesia

### Mechanism of Action
The mechanism of action for propofol is poorly understood but thought to be related to the effects on GABA-mediated chloride channels in the brain.

### Administration
**Route of Administration:** Intravenous

**Onset of action:** Propofol has a rapid onset of action that is dose-dependent, less than a minute.

**Duration of action:** An induction dose of propofol has a clinical effect for approximately 10 minutes. With prolonged or repeated administration, the drug accumulates in peripheral tissues and has an increased duration of action.

**Metabolism:** Hepatic oxidation and conjugation to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates.

**Clearance:** Hepatic clearance is approximately 60% with extra hepatic clearance making up the remaining 40%; the majority of which is via the kidneys.

**Half-life:** Propofol is bi-phasic with its initial half-life being relatively quick, around 40 minutes, and its terminal half-life usually being 4 to 7 hours. After a 10-day infusion the drug may be present for up to 1-3 days, but the clinical effect of propofol is much shorter in duration.

**Excretion:** Primarily renal.

### Adverse reactions
* Transient local pain at the injection site is the most common adverse reaction which may be decreased by administering IV lidocaine before propofol bolus.
* Hypotension
* Myoclonus
* Occasionally causes EKG changes (QT interval prolongation).  This is rarely clinically significant.
* Rarely causes discolored urine (a green tint)

### Pregnancy:
Propofol is safe for use in pregnancy but crosses the placenta and may be associated with neonatal CNS and respiratory depression.  It is the drug of choice for induction of general anesthesia in the stable obstetric patient and in the lowest risk class of all of the induction agents currently used.

### Drug Interactions:
Propofol may potentiate other medications that cause CNS or respiratory depression and a decrease in blood pressure. Caution is advised when using other agents that may prolong QT interval.

### Contraindications
Propofol is contraindicated in any patient that has any known hypersensitivity reaction to the drug. Caution should be taken in any patient with abnormally low blood pressure.  

Some package inserts state that propofol should not be given to those with reported allergies to eggs, egg products, soy or soy products. An allergic reaction occurs secondary to exposure to specific proteins from both egg and soy sources and not the fats (lecithin and oil, respectively) that make up the emulsion.   

### Monitoring
**Therapeutic effects of propofol:**
When administered as a bolus, propofol has a predictably rapid and smooth onset.

**Central nervous system effects:**
Propofol causes a dose-dependent decreased level of consciousness and can be used for moderate sedation to general anesthesia.  This decreased sensorium may lead to loss of protective airway reflexes and propofol should not be used in any patient unless they have a secure artifical airway or are appropriately fasting.  The American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) NPO guidelines should be used as a template for the duration of fast following varying oral intake.

Propofol will cause a decrease in cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, and cerebral oxygen consumption.  At higher doses, it can lead to an isoelectric EEG. It also has been shown to cause transient excitatory phenomena such as choreiform movements and opisthotonus (abnormal posturing caused by spasm of the muscles) after injection.

**Cardiovascular effects:**
Propofol causes vasodilation by inhibiting sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity along with mild depression of myocardial contractility which accounts for the hypotension often seen when administered. This effect can be substantial with a profound reduction in the mean arterial pressure, especially when propofol is administered as a bolus. Use caution in hypovolemic or in catecholamine-depleted patients.

**Respiratory effects:**
Propofol causes dose-dependent respiratory depression due to the inhibition of the hypercapnic ventilatory drive.  This respiratory depression is potentiated by concurrent use of other sedative agents (benzodiazepines, opioids, central acting alpha two agonists, or other anesthetic medications).  An induction dose of propofol will cause apnea.

Propofol has also been seen to cause a low incidence of bronchospasm in asthmatic patients.

**Additional monitoring requirements/precautions:**
Propofol can cause profound cardiovascular and respiratory depression and will ultimately end in general anesthesia if given in large enough doses.  For this reason, any practitioner who administers propofol must be qualified to care for a patient who is at any level of sedation (ranging from moderate sedation to general anesthesia).  Emergency equipment must be readily available and in good working order.  At a minimum, the ASA recommends monitoring of oxygenation, circulation, ventilation and temperature for all anesthetics.  

Rescue equipment should include a bag valve mask, two sources of oxygen (centrally supplied or cylinders), laryngoscopes, endotracheal tubes of differing sizes, laryngeal mask airways, a crash cart with appropriate ACLS medications and a defibrillator.   

### Toxicity
**Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS):** Is a rare but serious side effect of prolonged infusion of propofol (usually > 4mg/kg/h for more than 24 hours). The syndrome presents as metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperlipidemia, and rhabdomyolysis and may proceed to renal and cardiac failure and ultimately death.

The exact mechanism of PRIS is still unknown. The onset of PRIS usually occurs within four days of the initial propofol treatment. This syndrome has been noted to occur during prolonged infusions at high doses in pediatric/young adult patients or those with the need for prolonged sedation, such as mechanically ventilated patients with head trauma.

# ~Question 9
Which effect is expected after administration of propofol?

[WRONG] Increased respiratory rate
[RIGHT] Decreased level of consciousness
[WRONG] Increased blood pressure
[WRONG] Decreased QT interval duration

# ~Question 10
For which situation would propofol be used in the critical care unit?

[WRONG] Maintenance of general anesthesia
[WRONG] Relief of chronic pain
[WRONG] Facilitate sleep for tired patients
[RIGHT] Sedation in a mechanically-ventilated patient

# Fentanyl
A strong synthetic opioid, which produces analgesia similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. A dose of only 100 micrograms can produce equivalent analgesia to approximately 10 mg of morphine. However, fentanyl exhibits vastly different properties and pharmacokinetics. Clinically, it is most often used as a sedative in intubated patients, as well as in severe cases of pain in patients with renal failure owing to its primarily hepatic elimination. At times, fentanyl may also be indicated to treat chronic pain patients who have developed tolerance to opiates. When used as a sedative, it is most commonly administered as a drip. It may often require large doses when used as a sedative in patients with mechanical ventilation requirements.

### Mechanism of Action
Fentanyl is similar to other opioid drugs. Fentanyl molecules target a subclass of opioid receptor systems in the body, many of which are localized in the brain within specialized neuroanatomical structures particularly regarded to the control of emotions, pain, and speaking to the point of its infamous addictive properties, reward. Biochemically, it is referred to as a Mu-selective opioid agonist.

### Administration
Fentanyl is typically administered intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), transdermally (TD) as skin patches, intranasally (IN) in the form of a volatile nasal spray, and intrathecally (IT).


### Adverse Effects
Fentanyl's side effects are similar to those of heroin, which produce euphoria, confusion, respiratory depression (which, if extensive and untreated, may lead to arrest), drowsiness, nausea, visual disturbances, dyskinesia, hallucinations, delirium, analgesia, constipation, narcotic ileus, muscle rigidity, constipation, addiction, loss of consciousness, hypotension, coma, and even death. Alcohol and other drugs (i.e., cocaine, heroin) can synergistically exacerbate fentanyl's side effects.

### Contraindications
The use of fentanyl is contraindicated in patients,
* After operative interventions in the biliary tract, as these may slow hepatic elimination of the drug
* With respiratory depression or obstructive airway diseases (i.e., asthma, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation also know as, Pickwickian syndrome) unless they are menchanically ventilated
* With liver failure
* With known intolerance to fentanyl or other morphine-like drugs including codeine
* With known hypersensitivity (i.e., anaphylaxis) or to any of the common drug delivery excipients (i.e., sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide).

### Monitoring
When using fentanyl citrate injections along with medications such as CYP3A4 inhibitors, or stopping the CYP3A4 inducers in patients treated with fentanyl injections, the patients should be monitored closely and frequently. Also, consider lowering the dose of fentanyl.

### Toxicity
Typically, a fentanyl overdose manifests as respiratory depression or respiratory arrest. In such cases, oxygen administration and respiratory assistance should be performed accordingly. An opioid drug antagonist such as naloxone is indicated to correct symptoms. Commonly, repeated doses of naloxone over time. Thus, the therapeutic approach is continued until a normal respiratory rate coincides with appropriate oxygen saturation levels. Naloxone/naltrexone are robust opioid antagonists that function by blocking µ-receptors.  Naloxone is commonly administered IV, IM, IN or subcutaneously (SC).

# ~Question 11
Three of the routes below are used for administering fentanyl. Which route is NOT used for administering fentanyl?

[WRONG] Intramuscular (IM)
[WRONG] Intravenous (IV)
[WRONG] Transdermally (TD)
[RIGHT] Oral

# Versed
Intravenous midazolam (Versed) can be used for anxiolysis and hypnosis during general anesthesia and for to decrease anxiety and provide amnesia during prolonged mechaincal ventilation.

### Mechanism of Action
The mechanism of action of midazolam is indirect, related to GABA accumulation and its affinity to the benzodiazepine receptors. The anticonvulsant activity of midazolam is related to the excess GABA action on motor circuits in the brain. Midazolam acts on glycine receptors and produces a muscle relaxation effect. Almost all the pharmacologic effects, including sedation, anxiolysis, anterograde amnesia, and anticonvulsant effect, are explainable through its action on GABA receptors. Age-related deficits, hepatic, and renal insufficiency, also affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam.

### Administration
Midazolam administration can be through oral, intranasal, buccal, intravenous, and intramuscular routes. For intravenous sedation, the dose is titrated at 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg/hr.

### Adverse Effects
The common adverse effects associated with midazolam use are hiccups, cough, nausea, and vomiting. Thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, and pain on injection are other adverse effects. Midazolam causes anterograde amnesia, drowsiness, ataxia, falls, and confusion in the elderly. Hypotension and tachycardia can occur with rapid intravenous administration. A higher dose can result in midazolam infusion syndrome and respiratory depression. Instances of midazolam infusion syndrome require continuous ventilator support. Paradoxical effects of midazolam are possible in individuals with a history of alcohol abuse and aggressive behavior, potentially leading to involuntary movements, verbalization, uncontrollable crying, and aggressive behavior. Respiratory depression can happen with a dose of 0.15 mg/kg, and the risk increases when used along with fentanyl. Concomitant use of midazolam with other CNS depressants can result in severe respiratory depression and death even at therapeutic doses.

### Contraindications
Contraindications for the use of midazolam include acute angle-closure glaucoma, hypotension, and shock. Careful dose adjustment is necessary in cases of kidney and liver diseases, alcohol, and drug-dependent individuals. Caution is necessary for pregnant individuals, children, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric conditions. Administration in elderly individuals and acutely ill patients requires caution to prevent the accumulation of active metabolites. Extra precautions should be taken in critically ill individuals as dose accumulation can occur.

### Monitoring
Frequent monitoring of blood levels of midazolam and its metabolites is a requirement during the treatment of midazolam overdose. Levels of midazolam and its metabolites are measurable in blood, plasma, and serum. Monitoring is essential for elderly individuals and individuals with liver and kidney disease. The elimination of both the drug and its metabolite decreases with renal insufficiency. Monitoring is also necessary for drug interactions with erythromycin, clarithromycin, diltiazem, sertraline, protease inhibitors, rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, opioids, antipsychotics, and alcohol.

### Toxicity
Toxicity with midazolam is rare but can happen when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, opioids, and other tricyclic antidepressants. The risk increases with intravenous administration and in elderly individuals with COPD. Symptoms of overdose include ataxia, nystagmus, hypotension, slurred speech, slurred speech, impaired motor coordination, coma, and death. Flumazenil is the antidote for midazolam toxicity.

# ~Question 12
Three of the adverse effects below are associated with midazolam (Versed). Which adverse affect is NOT typically associated with midazolam (Versed)?

[RIGHT] Constipation
[WRONG] Cough
[WRONG] Hiccups
[WRONG] Vomiting

# Dilaudid
Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) is a pure opioid indicated for moderate to severe acute pain and severe chronic pain. It is only prescribed when other first-line of treatments have failed, due to its high potency, abuse potential, and overdose risk.

Intravenous solutions are available in the following formulations: 2 mg/1 ml, 2500 mg/250 ml, 10 mg/1 ml, 500 mg/50 ml.

### Mechanism of Action
Hydromorphone is an opioid agonist that binds to several opioid receptors. Its analgesic characteristics are through its effect on the mu-opioid receptors. It also acts centrally at the level medulla, depressing the respiratory drive and suppressing cough.

### Administration and dosing
Hydromorphone is administtered through intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or oral routes.

### Pharmacology
Excretion is mainly through urine in the glucuronidated form. The residual unchanged form gets excreted in the urine (7%) and the feces (1%).

### Adverse Effects
Common adverse effects include flushing, pruritus, sweating, dry mouth, nausea/vomiting, constipation, asthenia, dizziness, headache, and somnolence.
Serious adverse effects include hypotension, syncope, adrenal insufficiency, coma, raised intracranial pressure, seizure, suicidal thoughts, apnea, respiratory depression or respiratory arrest, drug dependence or drug withdrawal, and drug withdrawal syndrome in newborns

### Contraindications
Hydromorphone is contraindicated in patients reporting allergies to the drug itself, sulfites, or any other component of the formulation used.

Clinicians should not administer this drug to patients with bronchial asthma, or any other form of respiratory disease with clinical respiratory compromise; this can induce respiratory arrest.

Hydromorphone is to be avoided in any gastrointestinal obstruction or hypomotility, including ileus. Postoperative ileum should prompt careful administration of hydromorphone, to prevent prolonged ileus.

Hydromorphone should also to be avoided in genitourinary obstructions, central nervous system (CNS) depression, hypotension, and hypovolemia. It requires careful administration in cases of concomitant psychiatric illness.

### Monitoring
**Drug interactions**
Naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid receptor antagonists that can precipitate withdrawal symptoms when used along with hydromorphone, decreasing its analgesic effect.

The use of hydromorphone in patients taking safinamide (MAO inhibitor) can precipitate serotonin syndrome and necessitates caution in dosing. It also requires careful administration for patients taking selective serotonin inhibitors (SSRI) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) for this same reason.

Concurrent use of hydromorphone with other CNS depressants, including benzodiazepine and barbiturates, can induce severe respiratory and/or CNS depression.

### Toxicity
Overdose may cause respiratory depression and lead to death. Naloxone is the antidote, and repeated doses of naloxone may be needed.

# ~Question 13
Which drug is an antidote to Dilaudid?
[RIGHT] Naloxone
[WRONG] Flumazenil
[WRONG] Erythromycin

# ~Question 14
Which drug may cause respiratory depression and lead to death?

[WRONG] Dexmedetomidine
[WRONG] Versed
[RIGHT] Dilaudid

#  Dexmedetomidine
Dexomentadine (Precedex) is FDA-approved for sedation of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and peri-procedural (or peri-operative) sedation of non-intubated patients. Usage has expanded to off-label uses, including treatment and prevention of delirium, adjunctive analgesia, therapy for insomnia in the ICU, and treatment of alcohol withdrawal.  commonly produces a sedated state allowing patients to be both comfortable and cooperative during mechanical ventilation. Additionally, it does not require stoppage to accomplish extubation and is safe to use in non-intubated patients because it does not produce significant respiratory depression.

### Mechanism of Action
Dexmedetomidine is an alpha agonist having sedative, anxiolytic, hypnotic, analgesic, and sympatholytic properties. It produces these effects by inhibition of central sympathetic outflow by blocking the alpha receptors in the brainstem, thereby inhibiting the release of norepinephrine.

### Administration
For ICU sedation, the typical dosage range is 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. However, the dose can be increased to 1.5 mcg/kg/hr to achieve the desired sedation level. Dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic impairment are not required but should be considered, especially for hepatic impairment. The manufacturer does not recommend durations longer than 24 hours; however, longer durations have demonstrated to be safe and effective. Clinicians can administer a loading dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mcg/kg; this is usually not needed in labile critically ill patients.

When used in anesthesia, the typical dosing is a loading dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mcg/kg, usually followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg per hour titrated to desired sedation goals.

### Adverse Effects
The most common adverse effects of dexmedetomidine are hypotension, bradycardia, and hypertension. Hypertension can result from the stimulation of alpha subtypes of receptors in vascular smooth muscles and can be avoided by the slow administration or omission of the loading dose. Hypotension and bradycardia are the results of the stimulation of presynaptic alpha receptors, which leads to a decreased release of norepinephrine; this is in addition to the decrease in the central sympathetic outflow. These are concerns regardless of the route of administration.

### Contraindications
There are no absolute contraindications to the use of dexmedetomidine. However, it should be used cautiously in patients with bradycardia and hypotension. Additionally, it should be used cautiously in patients with known heart failure.

### Monitoring
There are no specific drug monitoring requirements. The level of sedation, heart rate/rhythm, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry require close monitoring.

### Toxicity
At present, there is no chemical reversal or antidote for dexmedetomidine. Supportive care and close monitoring are the treatment for overdose.

# ~Question 15
Dexmedetomidine should be used cautiously for patients with diabetes

[WRONG] True
[RIGHT] False

* Dexmedetomidine should be used cautiously for patients with bradycardia, hypotension and known heart failure

# Complications of Sedation
Complications can occur when providing continuous sedation to a mechanically ventialted patient. Some of those complications are:
* Inadequate Airway
* Hemodynamic instability
* Agitation
* Anaphylaxis
* Drug reactions

All of which will be discussed in the following articles.

## Inadequate Airway

### Loss of artificial airway
* To prevent this, vigilance is key
* Oxygen desaturation and tachycardia occur after two to three minutes

**What do we do about it?**
* Assure artifical airway is secure
* Assess bilateral breath sounds routinely and after position changes
* Note level of endotracheal tube insertion and assure it stays constant
* Provide supplemental oxygen
* Provide positive pressure ventilation; use bag/mask if ventilator function is uncertain
* Administer appropriate reversal agents
* Assess need for reintubation

## Hemodynamic Instability

### Hypotension
Hypotension is generally due to vasodilation. When managing hypotension, consider the following key actions:

1. Check the airway. Is it intact? If not, establish airway by head tilt/chin lift, airway adjuncts, bag valve mask, or intubation. Consider reversal of sedation.
2. Check ventilation and oxygen saturation. Is there effective ventilation and O2 saturation? If not, provide ventilatory support, supplemental O2 , and intubate if needed. Consider pulmonary emboli.
3. Check the cardiac rhythm. Is it the patient’s rhythm at baseline? If not, obtain 12 lead EKG then correct dysrhythmias. Does the patient have any signs of MI or ischemia?
4. Give a bolus of fluid. Was it effective? If not, look and treat for causes such as bleeding, anaphylaxis, sepsis, equipment malfunction, or complication of procedure.
5. Start vasopressors.

### Bradycardia
First, the practitioner must rule out hypoxia.

**What do we do about it?**
* Increase oxygen if needed
* Stop stimulus and assess rhythm
* Atropine: 0.5-1 mg IV q 3-5 minutes not to exceed 3 mg

### Tachycardia
Tachycardia is usually from pain and/or fever. The healthcare providers should consider the cause and co-morbidities of the patient. Sometimes it can be caused from epinephrine given locally.

**What do we do about it?**
* Fentanyl for pain: Vagotonic properties
* If from epinephrine, will generally resolve in a few minutes
* β-Blocker if prolonged and problematic, IV

### Hypertension
Hypertension is usually from pain or from epinephrine. Also consider hypercarbia.

**What do we do about it?**
* Analgesics as appropriate
* Labetalol: α and β antagonist 5-10 mg IV push
* Hydralazine: Direct vasodilator 5-10 mg IV (wait 10-20 minutes)

## Agitation
With agitation, the healthcare providers must rule out hypoxia or hypercarbia. It could also be from a paradoxical drug reaction, especially in elderly.

**What do we do about it?**
* Monitor respiratory status and treat accordingly
* Give benzodiazepines cautiously

## Managing Allergic Reactions/Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is most common with opioids but can occur with any drug. Reactions can occur within 60 minutes, with symptoms ranging from hives to bronchoconstriction, laryngeal edema, hypotension, or circulatory collapse. Other reactions include drug fever, vasculitis, serum sickness syndrome, and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).

**What do we do about it?**
* For mild reactions, stop offending agent and administer diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
* For severe reactions, O2 , IV crystalloids, epinephrine, and aminophylline. Diphenhydramine and ranitidine block unoccupied histamine receptors. Hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone also may be administered.

# ~Question 16
Which drug would be contraindicated for a patient experiencing hypertension?

[RIGHT] Atropine
[WRONG] Labetalol
[WRONG] Hydralazine

# ~Question 17
A patient experiencing agitation should be treated with hydralazine.

[WRONG] True
[RIGHT] False

# Patient Safety
### Basic Safety Measures
* Assess the patient’s comfort levels.
* Make sure the side rails are up and the wheels are locked.
* Ensure the suction device is set-up and ready.

## Patient Monitoring
Baseline vital signs should be documented prior to initiating sedation. The patient should be on continuous cardiac, respiratory, and oxygenation monitoring.
* Heart rate/ECG rhythm
* Respiratory rate
* Blood pressure
* O2 saturations/capnography

**Follow the unit policy for ongoing monitoring of patient sedation**
* Sedation score: Evaluate patient’s response to verbal commands or tactile stimulation (level of consciousness)
* Pain level
* Assess for and treat any unexpected patient reactions
* Document dose and timing of medications

### Capnography
More hospitals are using capnography to monitor the concentration of exhaled carbon dioxide in order to assess physiologic status or determine the adequacy of ventilation during anesthesia.This measurement verifies whether ventilation is occurring and will identify bradypnea, hypoventilation, and apnea much sooner than pulse oximetry.

**NOTE!**
Various sedation scales may be used, including the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), the Pasero Opioid-Induced Sedation Scale (POSS), and the Innova Health System Sedation Scale (ISS). Determine which scale your facility uses and become familiar with that particular scale.

[WRONG] Assessing the patient’s comfort levels
[WRONG] Making sure the side rails are up and the bed wheels are locked
[WRONG] Ensuring the suction device is set-up and ready
[RIGHT] Administering intravenous diphenhydramine

# ~Question 19
Which action would the nurse plan to use for a patient on mechanical ventilation who experiences henodynamic instability from a sedative overdose?

[WRONG] Assess the patient’s comfort levels
[WRONG] Make sure the side rails are up and the wheels are locked
[RIGHT] Administer a bolus of intravenous fluid
[WRONG] Ensure the suction device is set-up and ready
