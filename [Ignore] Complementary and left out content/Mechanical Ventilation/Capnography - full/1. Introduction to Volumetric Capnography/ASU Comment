% Comment from Elira: Several ventilators have (regular) capnography, which is CO2 eliminated by the patient over time (Y-axis --> expired CO2, X-axis -->time). The video discusses this. The e-book discusses VOLUMETRIC capnography. This is a useful technique, but not so commonly used. Only few ventilators have this. Volumetric capnography is Y-axis --> exprired CO2, X-axis expired volume CO2. It depends if they use Volumetric Capnography at Mount SInai. Again, this is useful but unfortunately not so much used in clinical practice. Can you ask if the use the NAVA mode of ventilation in the Servo ventilators at Mount Sinai?
