I think the title of this section should just include types of ventilators-- the different brands/types of machines-- or just modes-- these shouldn't be in the same module to reduce confusion- I did, however, include mode information here so it can be placed wherever once the decision is made

One thought : I don't know how valuable it is to share all of the different ventilator models -- I doubt anyone would remember the differences between a Trilogy and a Phillips for example-- I couldn't even tell you the names of all of the model's I've worked with- the key is that the nurse can identify important information in any model. Nurses do not need to know which models can run which modes- this is purely a respiratory therapist knowledge base, not RN

Alarms should be discussed in a separate section as well

I deleted some content that is not within the nurse's responsibility--- the respiratory therapist is in charge of setting up the vent, not the RN-- the RN needs to understand how to manage the vent and what specific settings and modes mean, but other than that, this could be seen as very "content-overloaded" since many experienced ICU nurses don't understand what a lot of this means since it isn't in our scope of practice
