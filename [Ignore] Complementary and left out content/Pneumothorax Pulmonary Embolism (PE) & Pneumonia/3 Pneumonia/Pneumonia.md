# Description
Pneumonia is one of the most common respiratory problems and it affects patients at all stages of life. It can be spread by droplets, and  aerosol inhalation, or result from interruptions in the respiratory microbiome. Pathogen growth and the immune response leads to damage of the lung parenchyma casuing pneumonia.

* **Pneumonia** is an **inflammation of the lung parenchyma** caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses.
* **Pneumonitis** is a more general term that describes the **inflammatory process in the lung tissue** that may predispose and place the patient at risk for microbial invasion.

## Pathophysiology 
Having an idea about the disease process helps the patient understand the treatment regimen and its importance, increasing patient compliance.

* Pneumonia arises from **normal flora** present in patients whose **resistance has been altered** or from **aspiration** of flora present in the oropharynx.
* An **inflammatory reaction** may occur in the alveoli, producing **exudates** that interfere with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
* **White blood cells** also migrate into the alveoli and **fill the normally air-filled spaces.**
* Due to secretions and mucosal edema, there are areas of the lung that are not adequately ventilated and cause partial occlusion of the alveoli or bronchi.
* **Hypoventilation** may follow, causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
* Venous blood entering the pulmonary circulation passes through the under ventilated areas and returns to the left side of the heart before being adequately oxygenated.
* The mixing of oxygenated and poorly oxygenated blood can result in **arterial hypoxemia**.

# ~Question 2
What is an acute infection of the lung caused by bacteria or viruses?

[RIGHT] Pneumonia
[WRONG] Pneumoconiosis
[WRONG] Pneumonitis
[WRONG] Pulmonary edema

# Classification
Pneumonia is classified into four main categories: 
* **Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).**
* **Nosocomial or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).**
* Pneumonia in the **immunocompromised** host. 
* **Aspiration pneumonia**.

## Community-Acquired Pneumonia

* CAP occurs either in the community setting or within the **first 48 hours after hospitalization**.
* The **causative agents** for CAP that needs hospitalization include **streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenza, Legionella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa**.
* Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and respiratory viruses are the most common pathogens identified in patients with CAP.
* A large number of cases (more than 50%) have no identifiable etiologic agent.
* **Streptococcus pneumoniae** is the **most common cause of CAP** in people younger than 60 years of age.
* Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in infants and children.

## Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia
* HAP is also called **nosocomial pneumonia** and is defined as the onset of pneumonia symptoms **more than 48 hours after admission** in patients with no evidence of infection at the time of admission.
* A common type of HAP in the ICU setting is **ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)** as the trachial tube can become a conduit for bacteria into the lungs. 
* HAP is the **most lethal nosocomial infection** and the leading cause of death in patients with such infections.
* Major risk factors for HAP are age > 70 years, abdominal or thoracic surgery, or functional debilitation.
* Common microorganisms that are responsible for HAP include **Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, influenza, Klebsiella species, Proteus, Serratia marcescens, S. aureus, and S. pneumonia**.
* The usual presentation of HAP is a **new pulmonary infiltrate** on chest x-ray combined with evidence of infection.

### The causes of HAP include the following:

* **Impaired host defenses.** When the defenses of the body are down, several pathogens may invade the body.
* **Comorbid conditions.** There are several conditions that lower the immune system, causing bacteria to pool in the lungs and eventually result in pneumonia.
* **Supine positioning.** When the patient stays in a prolonged supine position, fluid in the lungs pools down and stays stagnant, making it a breeding place for bacteria.
* **Prolonged hospitalization.** The risk for hospital infections or nosocomial infections increases the longer the patient stays in the hospital.

## Pneumonia in the Immunocompromised Host
* Pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts includes Pneumocystis pneumonia, fungal pneumonias and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
* Patients who are immunocompromised **commonly develop pneumonia from organisms of low virulence**.
* Pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts may be caused by the organisms also observed in HAP and CAP.

## Aspiration Pneumonia
* **Aspiration pneumonia refers** to the pulmonary consequences resulting from entry of endogenous or exogenous substances into the lower airway.
* The most common form of aspiration pneumonia is a bacterial infection casued when bacteria that normally reside in the upper airways are aspirated into the lungs.
* Aspiration pneumonia may occur in the community or hospital setting.
* Common pathogens are S. pneumonia, H. influenza, and S. aureus.

* Fever with chills and/or rigor
* Productive cough with purulent sputum
* Dyspnea (mild, exertional and rarely present at rest)
* Pleuritic chest pain adjecent to the area of the lungs affected (may manifest as upper abdominal pain when lower lobe infection irritates the diaphragm)
* GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) 

Symptoms become variable at the extremes of age. 
* Infection in infants may manifest as nonspecific irritability and restlessness
* In the elderly, manifestation may be as confusion and obtundation

* Fever (may be absent in the elderly)
* Tachypnea
* Tachycardia
* Crackles
* Bronchial breath sounds
* Egophony (E to A change—said to occur when, during auscultation, a patient says the letter “E” and the examiner hears the letter “A”),
* Dullness to percussion. 

Signs of pleural effusion may also be present. 

Signs for infants include:
* Nasal flaring

# Treatment
A variety of tests are used to diagnose pneumonia, identify the specific pathogen, and monitor treatment and recovry.

## Initial Diagnosis & Pathogen Identification
* **Chest x-ray.** Identifies presence ad location of infiltrates, interstitial markings. 
* **Sputum collection for gram stain/cultures.** Sputum can be produced by the patient for culture, or taken from bronchial washings, or deep sunctioning methods (tracheal or ventilator);  
* **Blood cultures.** Cultures can identify the causative organism when bacteremia is present.
* **Fiberoptic bronchoscopy.** May be both diagnostic (qualitative cultures) and therapeutic (re-expansion of lung segment).
* **Serologic studies, e.g., viral or Legionella titers, cold agglutinins.** Assist in differential diagnosis of specific organism.
* **Percutaneous aspiration/open biopsy of lung tissues.** May reveal typical intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions (CMV), characteristic giant cells (rubeola).
* **Pulmonary function studies.** Volumes may be decreased (congestion and alveolar collapse); airway pressure may be increased and compliance decreased. Shunting is present (hypoxemia).
* **Urine test.** This can used to identify the Legionella and pneumococcal antigens.
* **Pneumococcal antigen test.** This test is used whtn antibiotic therapy was started prior to obtaining sputum and blood cultures. 

## Ongoing Monitoring
* **Pulse oximetry and/or ABGs.** Oxygen sturation < 90%, PaO2 < 60 mmHg.
* **Mental status.** Confusion, especially in the elderly, can signal decompnesation and possible bacteremia.
* **Respiratory rate.** Tachypnea (> 30 bpm) is a signal of decreased ocygenation, and is a sign of increased work of breathing. 
* **Blood Pressure.** Hypotension (SBP < 90) is a sign of decreasing hemodynamic stability and dehydration.
* **CBC.** Leukocytosis usually present, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated.
* **BUN.** An elevated BUN (BUN ≥19 mg/dL [6.78 mmol/L]) is a sign of uremia.
* **Electrolytes.** Sodium and chloride levels may be low.
* **Bilirubin.** May be increased.

# ~Question 7

[RIGHT] Elevated ESR
[WRONG] PaO2 of 70 mmHg
[RIGHT] Leukocytosis
[WRONG] BUN = 2.5 mg/dL

# ~Question 8

[RIGHT] Blood culture
[WRONG] D-Dimer
[WRONG] V/Q scan
[RIGHT] Sputum stain

# Nursing Interventions
**Improve airway patency:**
* **Removal of secretions.** Secretions should be removed because retained secretions interfere with gas exchange and may slow recovery.
* **Oral care** is critical, especially for patients receiving mechanical ventillation
* **Adequate hydration** of 2 to 3 liters per day thins and loosens pulmonary secretions.
* **Humidification** will protect the integrity of the airway, and may loosen secretions and improve ventilation.
* **Coughing exercises.** An effective, directed cough can also improve airway patency.
* **Incentive Spirometry.** This promotes positive pressure to keep the alveoli open to improve oxygenation.
* **Frequent turning.** Assist the patient to change positions frequently to enhance secretion clearance and pulmonary ventilation and perfusion.
* **Chest physiotherapy.** Chest physiotherapy is important because it loosens and mobilizes secretions.

**Control symptoms:**
* **Antipyretics** are used to treat fever and headache.
* **Antitussives** are used for treatment of the associated cough.

**Promote rest and conserve energy**
* Encourage **avoidance of overexertion** which can lead to possible exacerbation of symptoms.
* **Semi-Fowler’s position.** The patient should assume a comfortable position with the hear od the bed elevated 30 degrees or more to promote breathing and 

**Promote fluid intake:**
* **Fluid intake.** Increase in fluid intake to at least 2L per day to replace insensible fluid losses.

**Maintain adequate nutrition:**
* Fluids with electrolytes. This may help provide fluid, calories, and electrolytes.
* Nutrition-enriched beverages. Nutritionally enhanced drinks and shakes can also help restore proper nutrition.

**Promote patient knowledge:**
* Instruct patient and family about the cause of pneumonia, management of symptoms, signs, and symptoms, and the need for follow-up.
* Instruct patient about the factors that may have contributed to the development of the disease.

**Discharge panning:**
* **Oral antibiotics.** Teach the patient about the proper administration, potential side effects, and symptoms to report.
* **Breathing exercises.** Teach the patient breathing exercises to promote secretion clearance and volume expansion.
* **Follow-up check up.** Strict compliance to follow-up checkups is important to check the latest chest x-ray result or physical examination findings.
* **Smoking cessation.** Smoking should be stopped because it inhibits tracheobronchial ciliary action and irritates the mucous cells of the bronchi.
* **Pneumococcal vaccine.** This vaccine can prevent pneumonia in healthy patients with an **efficiency of 65% to 85%.**
